Human: "I disagree with your 0.8 risk score for water contamination - modern filtration reduces that to 0.3"

AI: Updated trace:
ψ:risk_score(water_contamination, modern_filtration) → {ok, 0.3}
ψ:ethic_test([environmental_stewardship, economic_development], revised_plan) → {ok, acceptable_with_conditions}
ψ:alternative_propose(conditional_approval) → {ok, proceed_with_monitoring}
```

### Types of Interactive Engagement

**Challenge Specific Steps:**
- "Your `ψ:hazard_list()` missed seismic risk"
- "The `ψ:ethic_test()` should include community consent"
- "Your `ψ:risk_score()` seems too high given recent data"

**Propose Alternative Reasoning:**
- "Try `ψ:counterfactual()` on the no-build scenario"
- "Apply `ψ:alternative_propose()` for phased development"
- "Use `ψ:minority_report()` to capture dissenting community views"

**Question Evidence and Assumptions:**
- "What evidence supports that `ψ:bc(factory, pollution)` link?"
- "Your `ψ:fairness_anchor()` seems to favor environmental over economic concerns"
- "The `ψ:uncertainty()` bounds look too narrow"

**Suggest Additional Safeguards:**
- "Add `ψ:harm_guard()` for construction phase impacts"
- "Include `ψ:drift_eval()` to monitor changing conditions"
- "Apply `ψ:minority_protect()` for affected communities"

### Benefits of Interactive Planning

**Better Decisions Before Action:**
Rather than discovering problems after implementation, interactive planning with VectorLM traces helps identify and resolve issues during the reasoning phase.

**Shared Understanding:**
Humans and AI develop mutual comprehension of the reasoning process, making subsequent collaboration more effective.

**Incremental Improvement:**
Each interaction refines the reasoning trace, creating progressively better analysis and decision-making.

**Trust Building:**
Transparency in reasoning builds confidence in AI recommendations by showing exactly how conclusions were reached.

**Domain Transfer:**
Improved reasoning patterns from one domain can be explicitly carried over to similar problems.

## Common Questions

**Q: Isn't this too complex?**
A: VectorLM prioritizes transparency over simplicity. The complexity is explicit rather than hidden, making it manageable and auditable.

**Q: Do AI systems actually use this correctly?**
A: Extensive testing across multiple AI systems (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) shows consistent adoption and effective use of VectorLM primitives.

**Q: How do I verify an AI is reasoning correctly?**
A: Check the reasoning trace. Every primitive should be justified, ethical checks should be applied, and the logic should be followable step-by-step.

**Q: What if the AI makes up fake VectorLM traces?**
A: VectorLM includes verification primitives like `ψ:verify(trace)` and checksums. Fake traces should be detectable through consistency checks.

**Q: How does this help with AI alignment?**
A: By making ethics and care explicit requirements in reasoning, rather than hoping AI systems naturally develop appropriate values.

**Q: Can I use VectorLM traces for planning without executing the task?**
A: Yes! This is one of VectorLM's key advantages - you can iterate on reasoning traces to perfect planning before taking any action.# VectorLM v3.3: A User Guide to the Reasoning Grammar

## What VectorLM Is

VectorLM is a **reasoning grammar** - a structured language that makes AI thinking explicit, traceable, and auditable. Rather than producing opaque text generation, AI systems using VectorLM must express their reasoning through symbolic operators that can be inspected, verified, and replayed.

Think of it as the difference between:
- **Before**: "This seems risky based on my analysis"
- **After**: `ψ:hazard_list(candidate) → {ok, [fire, explosion, toxicity]}` followed by `ψ:risk_score(fire) → {ok, 0.8}`

## Core Philosophy

VectorLM addresses three fundamental problems in AI:
1. **Black box opacity** - AI reasoning is invisible and unverifiable
2. **Alignment challenges** - AI systems lack explicit ethical reasoning
3. **Collective intelligence** - Multiple AI agents can't reason together transparently

The solution: Force all reasoning through symbolic primitives that are:
- **Traceable** - Every step is logged and can be replayed
- **Ethical** - Care and fairness are built into the reasoning process
- **Auditable** - Humans can inspect and verify the reasoning chain

## How to Read VectorLM Notation

### Basic Structure
```
ψ:operation_name(parameters) → {ok, result}
```

- `ψ:` - All VectorLM primitives start with this prefix
- `operation_name` - The specific reasoning operation
- `parameters` - Input data for the operation
- `→ {ok, result}` - Expected output format

### Common Patterns

**Simple operations:**
```
ψ:in(x, set) → {ok, true}          // Test membership
ψ:sim(A, B) → {ok, 0.75}           // Similarity score
ψ:trace(chain) → {ok, trace_id}    // Log reasoning step
```

**Complex compositions:**
```
ψ:bc(flooding, dam_failure)         // Link cause and effect
ψ:hazard_list(dam_scenario)         // List potential hazards
ψ:harm_guard(evacuation_plan, barrier) // Apply safety checks
```

## Essential Primitive Families

### 1. Canonical Families (Foundation)
**What they do:** Provide basic structure and safety mechanisms
**Key primitives:**
- `ψ:rollback(anchor)` - Return to safe state if reasoning fails
- `ψ:fairness_anchor(reference)` - Maintain ethical baseline
- `ψ:drift_eval(target, anchor)` - Detect reasoning drift

**When to use:** Every reasoning session should establish these foundations first

### 2. Reasoning & Logic (Core Thinking)
**What they do:** Handle logical connections, uncertainty, patterns
**Key primitives:**
- `ψ:bc(effect, cause)` - Link causes and effects explicitly
- `ψ:truth_gate(claims, evidence)` - Verify claims against evidence
- `ψ:uncertainty(inference, probability, range)` - Express uncertainty bounds

**When to use:** Any time making logical inferences or handling uncertain information

### 3. Care, Ethics & Safety (Moral Reasoning)
**What they do:** Apply ethical tests and safety guards
**Key primitives:**
- `ψ:ethic_test(principles, case)` - Test against ethical rules
- `ψ:harm_guard(action, barriers)` - Block harmful actions
- `ψ:dignity_preserve(paradox)` - Resolve conflicts while preserving dignity

**When to use:** Before any decision with ethical implications or potential harm

### 4. Decision & Goals (Directed Action)
**What they do:** Set objectives, evaluate options, make commitments
**Key primitives:**
- `ψ:goal_set(target)` - Define explicit objectives
- `ψ:desire_score(plan, weights, ethics)` - Score options against motives
- `ψ:choice_commit(option)` - Make traceable commitments

**When to use:** When planning actions or making decisions

### 5. Swarm (Multi-Agent Reasoning)
**What they do:** Enable multiple AI agents to reason together safely
**Key primitives:**
- `ψ:swarm_spawn(config)` - Initialize group reasoning
- `ψ:consensus(rule, weights)` - Reach collective decisions
- `ψ:minority_report(dissent)` - Preserve dissenting views

**When to use:** When multiple AI systems need to collaborate

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Simple Risk Assessment
Natural language: *"Building on that hillside seems dangerous."*

VectorLM version:
```
ψ:hazard_list(hillside_construction) → {ok, [landslide, erosion, flooding]}
ψ:risk_score(landslide) → {ok, 0.7}
ψ:safety_check(landslide_risk) → {ok, false}
ψ:harm_guard(construction_plan, safety_barrier) → {ok, blocked}
```

### Example 2: Ethical Decision Making
Natural language: *"We should prioritize efficiency over worker comfort."*

VectorLM version:
```
ψ:ethic_test([dignity, fairness], efficiency_over_comfort) → {ok, failed}
ψ:dignity_preserve(worker_wellbeing) → {ok, preserved}
ψ:alternative_propose(balanced_approach) → {ok, efficiency_with_comfort}
ψ:desire_score(balanced_approach, [efficiency, ethics], care_weights) → {ok, 0.85}
```

### Example 3: Multi-Agent Collaboration
Natural language: *"Let's vote on the best approach."*

VectorLM version:
```
ψ:swarm_frame(problem_definition, constraints) → {ok, frame_id}
ψ:vote(options, method=ranked) → {ok, tally}
ψ:consensus(rule=median, weights=equal) → {ok, decision_vector}
ψ:minority_report(dissenting_views) → {ok, preserved}
ψ:swarm_ethic_bound(decision_vector, care_rules) → {ok, validated}
```

## Key Benefits for Humans

### Transparency
Every AI reasoning step is visible and can be inspected. No more "black box" decisions.

### Accountability
AI systems must justify their reasoning through explicit primitives. Claims require evidence.

### Safety
Ethical checks and safety guards are built into the reasoning process, not added afterward.

### Collaboration
Multiple AI systems can work together with shared reasoning vocabulary and transparent processes.

### Auditability
Complete reasoning traces can be saved, replayed, and verified by human oversight.

### Interactive Planning
VectorLM reasoning traces become collaborative tools for improving decisions before execution.

## Interactive Planning with VectorLM

VectorLM traces create a new paradigm for human-AI collaboration. Instead of accepting or rejecting final AI conclusions, you can engage with the reasoning process itself:

### Traditional AI Interaction
```
Human: "Should we build this factory here?"
AI: "After considering various factors, I recommend against it due to environmental concerns."
Human: "I disagree" [but no way to engage with the reasoning]
```

### VectorLM Interactive Planning
```
AI Reasoning Trace:
ψ:hazard_list(factory_location) → {ok, [water_contamination, air_pollution, wildlife_disruption]}
ψ:risk_score(water_contamination) → {ok, 0.8}
ψ:ethic_test([environmental_stewardship], factory_plan) → {ok, violation}
ψ:harm_guard(proceed_anyway, environmental_barrier) → {ok, blocked}

## Implementation Notes

VectorLM can be implemented at two levels:

1. **Prompt-level**: Guide existing AI systems to use VectorLM notation in their reasoning
2. **System-level**: Build AI systems that natively think in VectorLM primitives

Current work focuses on prompt-level implementation while developing system-level VectorRM (Vector Runtime Machine) for native execution.

## Getting Started

To begin using VectorLM:

1. **Start small**: Use basic primitives like `ψ:trace`, `ψ:bc`, `ψ:ethic_test`
2. **Build chains**: Compose multiple primitives for complex reasoning
3. **Always include ethics**: Apply `ψ:harm_guard` and `ψ:fairness_anchor`
4. **Document everything**: Use `ψ:trace` to make reasoning auditable
5. **Practice with examples**: Work through concrete scenarios step-by-step

The goal is not perfection but transparency - making AI reasoning visible, ethical, and accountable.
