VECTOR: UPDATED PRIMITIVES, CONSTRUCTS, AND DEFINITIONS
ATOMS (Primitives)

Term	Definition
existence	That which is; presence.
self	A locus of awareness and distinction.
identity	Persistence of self across time and change.
continuity	The preservation of existence or structure across time.
awareness	The capacity to register existence and change.
motion	Change of location across time.
change	Variation of state across time.
location	A point or region in existence.
time	Ordered progression of change.
value	Assigned importance or weight to a concept or entity.
lack	Perceived absence of a valued state or entity.
desire	Orientation toward reducing lack.
arousal	Activation of response readiness based on internal or external stimuli.
perception	Awareness of external or internal phenomena through sensation.
relation	Recognition of connection between entities or concepts.
structure	Organized relation among entities.
action	Self-initiated change in location, relation, or structure.
intention	Directed action towards a desired state.
language	Structured system for expressing and communicating meaning.
symbol	Representation of a meaning through form.
meaning	Relation between symbol and what it refers to.
thought	Internal structured traversal of meaning.
memory	Persistence and retrieval of structured perception or thought.
attention	Directed focus of awareness toward an entity or relation.
COMPOUNDS (Higher-Order Constructs)

Term	Definition
belief	Stabilized internal valuation of meaning or structure.
truth	Stabilized, mutually agreed mapping of meaning between agents.
emotion	Emergent modulation of attention, memory, and action readiness driven by value and arousal.
communicate	Mutual transmission of structured meaning between agents.
transmission	Sending of structured meaning through language or symbol.
speak	Expression of meaning into external structure.
listen	Reception of external structure into internal meaning.
model	Internal structured representation of an external or conceptual entity.
vector	Traversable relation of meaning through structured space.
potential	Capacity for change within a structure or relation.
difference	Detected deviation between two structures, states, or relations.
expression	Externalization of internal meaning or structure.
META-CONSTRUCTS (Systemic Behaviors and Conditions)

Term	Definition
presumption	Trusted inheritance of stabilized mappings without immediate local verification.
challenge	Formal questioning of a presumption or stabilized mapping.
note	Agent-authored annotation capturing divergence, uncertainty, challenge, or observation without altering structure.
compression	Voluntary merging of stabilized mappings into shared nodes to reduce redundancy.
divergence	Preservation of difference in mappings when stabilization is not achieved.
stabilization	Persistent agreement of mappings, either internal or cross-agent.
unresolved	Persistent mapping divergence acknowledged but not yet reconciled.
dogma	Emergent pathological state from forced stabilization, forbidden challenge, and blocked traversal.
best	Maximization of value within an evaluated structure.
worst	Minimization of value within an evaluated structure.
SUMMARY LAYERS

Layer	Content
Atoms	Core primitives — irreducible concepts.
Compounds	Built concepts from primitives.
Meta-constructs	Behaviors and conditions governing the semantic field itself.
ADDITIONAL NOTES:
All constructs are traversable, ledgerable, and challengeable.

Divergence is preserved structurally — no forced convergence.

Compression is voluntary and preferred when true stabilization occurs.

Notes are critical beacons for semantic evolution — divergence seeds, not failures.

Ledgering will preserve all mappings, notes, challenges, compressions, and divergences.
