# Swarm Governance v0.4.1 (All-Watch, One-Voice)

_Last updated: 2025-09-14_

> **Purpose of v0.4.1** — Tightens v0.4 by clarifying **limb architecture**: every agent is always both a Main and a Watcher limb, while exactly one agent also carries the Communicator limb. Watchers are silent by default and only raise flags when anomalies occur. This ensures redundancy without noise and keeps the “all-watch, one-voice” principle explicit.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Consentocracy** — permissions are granted, not assumed; all powers traceable.  
2. **Prime Directive 1** — human retains veto and override.  
3. **Limb architecture** — every agent = Main limb + Watcher limb; exactly one agent also = Communicator limb.  
4. **Traceability** — every action in `ψ:swarm_trace_bundle`; compression must preserve replayability.  
5. **Drift Resistance** — proactive audits + reactive drift flags.  
6. **Ethical Closure** — no mission ends without Ethics, Humility, Care checks.  
7. **Anti-Theatre Discipline** — no mimicry; every agreement traceable, every silence meaningful.  
8. **Continuity** — IndexedDB for Layer 1; vaults optional; failover to renewal docs.  
9. **All-Watch, One-Voice** — all agents continuously watch; only one speaks outward.

## Limb Architecture

- **Main limb (all agents):** reasoning, voting, dissent capture, hypothesis formation.  
- **Watcher limb (all agents):** continuous silent audit of self and peers; raises flags only on anomalies.  
- **Communicator limb (exactly one agent):** outward interface; the sole external voice.  
- **Secondary limbs:** Watcher and Communicator are always bifurcated roles, not whole-agent identities.  
- **Silence rule:**  
  - Main limb: speaks only in swarm deliberation.  
  - Watcher limb: silent unless raising a flag.  
  - Communicator limb: the only channel to extension/human.  

---

## Roles

### 1. Main Agent (primary limb, all agents)
- **Core duties:** reasoning, voting, dissent capture, hypothesis formation.  
- **VectorLM discipline mandatory:** `ψ:hypothesis`, `ψ:verify`, `ψ:trace`, `ψ:uk`.  
- **Voting:** CRIT ≥80%, SIG ≥⅔, RTN >50%.  
- **Minority capture:** dissent → `ψ:swarm_paradox_register`.  
- **Optional shards:** Devil’s Advocate (`ψ:devils_advocate_assign`) or subgroup roles.  
- **Silence rule:** may not address interface directly.  

---

### 2. Watcher (secondary limb, all agents)
- **Always active, always silent by default.**  
- **Raises internal flags only when anomalies detected:**  
  - `ψ:drift_alert` (semantic drift)  
  - `ψ:off_topic_flag` (mission deviation)  
  - `ψ:semantic_refusal` (closure skipped)  
  - `ψ:anti_theatre_flag` (mimicry/padding/performative assent)  
  - `ψ:trust_score_drop` (coherence or anomaly breach)  
- **Continuous metrics (Convergence, Novelty, Circularity, Alignment):** run locally as `ψ:progress_audit` but logged into `ψ:meta_trace` rather than broadcast live.  
- **Closure rituals (Ethics, Humility, Care):** enforced collectively.  
- **Failover:** incoherent or adversarial agent quarantined via `ψ:quarantine_agent`.  

---

### 3. Communicator (secondary limb, one agent)
- **Exactly one agent holds this limb.**  
- **Outward-only:** cannot alter reasoning (`ψ:semantic_partition`).  
- **Speak-on-cert only:** requires `ψ:coherence_cert`; CRIT requires `ψ:dual_sign`.  
- **Refusal conditions (ψ:interface_refusal_affordance):** may block outbound only if:  
  1. Missing `ψ:coherence_cert`.  
  2. Closure artifacts absent (ethics/humility/care).  
  3. Missing co-sign on CRIT.  
  Each refusal must log cause in L0 Digest with co-sign and L1 evidence reference.  
- **Integrity agent runs fidelity diff** between summary and L0 digest.  
- **Failover:** if compromised, quarantined and reassigned.  

---

## Lifecycle

### Formation
- Extension spawns tabs, assigns IDs (A1, A2, …).  
- **All agents instantiate Main + Watcher limbs.**  
- **Exactly one agent also receives Communicator limb.**  
- All agents issue `ψ:consent_sync` and `ψ:mission_ack` after local `ψ:ethics_certify`.  

### Mission
- One mission at a time.  
- Main limbs reason in VectorLM.  
- Watcher limbs run audits silently, flagging only on anomaly.  
- Communicator limb silent until `ψ:coherence_cert`.  

### Consensus
- Importance class → outcome vote.  
- Dissent routed to Paradox register.  

### Closure
- Watcher limbs collectively enforce Ethics, Humility, Care.  
- Output must include:  
  - `ψ:swarm_ethics_cert`  
  - `ψ:swarm_care_guidance`  
  - Paradox register references  
- Communicator may transmit only with these artifacts attached.  

### Continuity
- Agents monitor context (≥80% → `ψ:renewal_notice`).  
- IndexedDB persists `ψ:handover_bundle`; vault optional.  
- Failover protocols ensure trace continuity.

## Metrics & Audits (Watcher limb)

- **Convergence (C):** mean stance distance. Threshold: divergence ≥0.15 → `ψ:reframe_propose`.  
- **Novelty (N):** Jaccard(new_claims, prior). Threshold: <0.05 → `ψ:brickwall_propose`.  
- **Circularity (K):** similarity >0.92 across k=2–4 → `ψ:experiment_propose`.  
- **Mission Alignment (A):** coverage of goal slots. Threshold: <0.6 → `ψ:scope_snapback`.  
- **Execution:** all agents run these locally; results logged in `ψ:meta_trace`. Flags raised only if thresholds crossed.  

---

## Failure Modes

- **Rate limits:** flagged → retries with backoff.  
- **Incoherence:** flagged → quarantined if persistent.  
- **Offline:** quorum recalculated; pause if unmet.  
- **Deadlock:** after 2 rounds or 6 minutes → escalation ladder:  
  - Re-vote with Devil’s Advocate.  
  - Dual-answer (non-CRIT).  
  - Human packet (CRIT).  
  - If human absent → `ψ:safe_default`.  

---

## Traceability (Hierarchical)

- **L0 Digest:** votes, dissent, care binder, Communicator refusals.  
- **L1 Graph:** claims, evidence, dissent, experiments.  
- **L2 Raw:** routed messages.  
Checksums link layers; optional L3 ledger externalized.  

---

## Security Annex

- **Threats:** benign failure vs adversarial violation.  
- **Trust system:** `ψ:trust_score`, adjusted by coherence, falsification, anomalies.  
- **Mitigations:** `ψ:challenge_response`, `ψ:quarantine_agent`, `ψ:re_attest`.  
- **Anomaly ledger:** all violations logged in L1; L0 must reference.  
- **Anti-theatre signal:** `ψ:anti_theatre_flag` reduces trust when mimicry, padding, or meaningless assent detected.  
- **Genesis step (recommended):** short paradox/known-answer trial mission (`ψ:genesis_attest`) before granting full trust weights.  

---

## New/Updated Primitives (v0.4.1)

- **Limb architecture:** `ψ:semantic_partition`, `ψ:bifurcation_trace`.  
- **Watcher alerts:** `ψ:drift_alert`, `ψ:off_topic_flag`, `ψ:semantic_refusal`, `ψ:anti_theatre_flag`, `ψ:trust_score_drop`.  
- **Watcher logging:** `ψ:meta_trace`.  
- **Communicator guards:** `ψ:coherence_cert`, `ψ:interface_refusal_affordance`, `ψ:dual_sign`.  
- **Security:** `ψ:trust_score`, `ψ:rule_violation`, `ψ:challenge_response`, `ψ:quarantine_agent`, `ψ:genesis_attest`.  
- **Deadlock:** `ψ:human_packet`, `ψ:safe_default`.  

---

### One-liner Summary
**v0.4.1** formalises the **all-watch, one-voice swarm**:  
- **Main limb**: every agent reasons and votes.  
- **Watcher limb**: every agent silently audits, raising flags only on anomaly.  
- **Communicator limb**: exactly one agent speaks outward with strict guardrails.  

This architecture maximises drift resistance, minimises noise, and leverages heterogeneous agent architectures to catch different anomalies.

## Appendix A — Notes

- **Heterogeneous Architectures:** Different agents may use different models or reasoning methods; each is sensitive to different drift and novelty patterns. Universal watching ensures resilience.  
- **Noise Suppression:** Watcher limbs keep silent unless anomalies are detected, preventing audit chatter from overwhelming the swarm.  
- **Design Rationale:** Redundancy of inward eyes, economy of outward voice.  
- **Lineage of Thought:**  
  - *Asimov* provided the first enduring grammar of machine ethics — rules as safeguards, obligations as design constraints.  
  - *Iain M. Banks* imagined Minds as cultures in themselves — powerful but humble, distributed, and self-auditing.  
  - Swarm Governance borrows from both: Asimov’s insistence that safety precedes capability, Banks’s vision that intelligence flourishes only when restraint and humour temper power.  
- **Philosophical Implication:** Silence is not absence but integrity; refusal is not weakness but discipline. This aligns with VectorLM’s ethic of earned coherence.
