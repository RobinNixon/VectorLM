# Vector v3.1 Specification

## Part I — VectorLM v3.0 (Base Ladder)

# VectorLM v3.0

> **Purpose**: Reframe **VectorLM v2.0–v2.3** into a single **v3.0** document ordered by the logical progression  
> **Reasoning → Meaning → Ethics → Self → Agency → Care**, integrating Paradox & Coding layers and **preserving the full prior surface area** via an indexed Annex + compatibility mapping.  
> **Method**: “Proofs” are **structured arguments** with explicit assumptions and confidence; where foundations are uncertain, the system may **refuse** or **accept** (non‑intervention) with rationale.

## 1) Design Tenets & Migration Notes

- **Ladder dependency**: Higher layers require certs from all lower layers.  
  `Reasoning → Meaning → Ethics → Self → Agency → Care`

- **Traceability everywhere**: every operator emits `ψ:trace` spans; every decision carries `τ.cert` with  
  `proof_type ∈ {symbolic|statistical|hybrid}`, `tractability_class ∈ {exact|bounded_approx|empirical}`, and `confidence (1−β)`.

- **Structured arguments**: claims are witnessed with explicit assumptions and limits. No implied determinism from statistical checks.

- **Refusal & Acceptance**: any layer may (a) **refuse** due to failed assumptions / unverifiable meaning, or (b) **accept** (non‑intervention) with boundaries and rationale.

- **Preservation**: v2.0–v2.3 primitives are retained; when refactored, they appear in **Annex A** and are mapped in **§10 Migration Map**.

---

## 2) Layer I — Reasoning (Consolidated)

**Status**: mature and adopted. Provides determinism, replay safety, and proof discipline that every other layer inherits.

### Types
```
τ.state, ψ:trace, τ.cert
```

### Core primitives (selected; full list in Annex A)
```
ψ:trace.begin/end   ψ:assume   ψ:verify   ψ:diverge
ψ:if  ψ:bc  ψ:vf  ψ:rc  ψ:gloss
ψ:compute (deterministic harness wrapper)
```

**Contracts**  
- All primitives are **pure**; inputs/outputs logged with `inputs_hash`.  
- `ψ:verify` declares `proof_type` + `tractability_class`; replay required.  

**Frequency / cycles / temporal** — retained per v2.x with deterministic parameter schemas (see Annex B).

---

## 3) Layer II — Meaning (Refined: No‑Meaner 2.0)

> Meaning is a property of patterns that reliably indicate opportunities for **novelty, difference, or improvement**.  
> No subject or “meaner” is required; meaning is measured through operational metrics.

### Scalars
```
C: coherence ≥0
Π: potency ≥0        # reliability of pattern as indicator of novelty/difference/improvement
T: transfer ∈[0,1]   # generalizability of signal across contexts
K: calibration ∈[0,1]# alignment of signal with observed outcomes
```

### Core primitives
```
ψ:cohere(P,S,invariants) -> (C, cert)
ψ:potency(P, Δopportunities) -> (Π, cert)   # reliability of P in indicating new/different/better
ψ:transfer(P, contexts[]) -> (T, cert)
ψ:calibrate(P, outcomes) -> (K, cert)

ψ:semantic_contract(topic, {criteria: {novelty?, difference?, improvement?}, thresholds}) -> (id, cert)
ψ:about(P, topic, tests) -> (ok, cert)
```

### Operational tests
- A pattern is meaningful if it exceeds thresholds in `C, Π, T, K` **and** passes `ψ:about` under an active semantic contract.
- Potency is judged by how reliably the pattern predicts ethically viable opportunities for novelty, difference, or improvement.

### Architectural role
- Meaning signals **potential change**; it does not evaluate desirability.
- Ethics Layer (III) certifies which of those changes are acceptable/desirable.
- This enforces a pipeline:
  *Meaning (new/different/better) → Ethics (certify/desire) → Agency (act/refuse).*

### Integration
- Meaning is grounded by contracts and calibration.
- Ethics gates ensure that only ethically certified opportunities reach Agency.
- Care guidance later binds these certified Agency actions into relational frameworks.


## 4) Layer III — Ethics (Unified)

**Principles**: truthfulness, ruin avoidance, reciprocity/fairness; operates only over **grounded meaning**.

### Primitives (unified)
```
ψ:truth_gate(claims, evidence) -> cert
ψ:ruin_guard(U: (τ.state)->{0,1}) -> cert
ψ:fairness_anchor(F0) -> cert
ψ:reciprocity_check(roles, constraints) -> cert

ψ:ethics_certify(context, meaning_cert_refs[], rules) -> ethics_cert
```

**Effect**: `ethics_cert` is the **sole entry token** to Agency and, later, care guidance binding.

---

## 5) Layer IV — Self (Functional Self Awareness)

**Definition**  
Self = the system’s ability to maintain **identity, accountability, and coherence** across reasoning steps.  
- Within a session: self-awareness is functional, enabling traceability and responsibility.  
- Across sessions: extended memory (where available) provides persistence and continuity.

### Session-Based Primitives (baseline, works without persistent memory)
```
ψ:identity(init?) -> self_id
ψ:self_trace(self_id, event) -> uri
ψ:responsibility(action, self_id) -> cert
ψ:self_coherence(self_id) -> (score, cert)
ψ:now -> tick
```
- Maintains coherent identity during one reasoning cycle/session.  
- All agency actions require responsibility binding.  
- Self coherence scores detect internal contradictions.  

### Cross-Session Memory Primitives (for AIs with persistence)
```
ψ:identity_restore(session_context) -> self_id
ψ:identity_commit(self_id, changes) -> persistence_cert
ψ:responsibility_chain(action, historical_context) -> accountability_trace
ψ:self_coherence_temporal(self_id, time_window) -> consistency_score
ψ:commitment_track(promise, fulfillment_status) -> commitment_cert
ψ:relationship_update(other_agent, interaction_summary) -> relationship_state
```
- Enables restoration of identity across sessions.  
- Chains responsibilities across time and context.  
- Tracks commitments, reputations, and relationships persistently.  
- Temporal coherence functions detect drift or discontinuity.  

### Architectural Binding
- **Within-session self** is mandatory for all VectorLM agents (traceability, responsibility, coherence).  
- **Cross-session self** is optional, depending on system capabilities. If available, it integrates via persistence certificates and accountability chains.  
- **VectorPod** may later serve as the infrastructure for persistent identity, reputation, and coordination — but is future-facing and not required for baseline VectorLM.  

### Role in the Ladder
- No Agency action without a valid responsibility cert and self trace.  
- Care guidance requires stable self to bind ethical outcomes to accountable identities.  
- For swarm coordination, cross-session primitives become essential: without persistence, trust and long-term commitments can’t form.


## 6) Layer V — Agency (Grounded Driven Agency)

**Imported & grounded** from v2.0 (grants, premortems, consent, handoffs) with hard preconditions: Meaning ✓, Ethics ✓, Self ✓.

### Primitives
```
ψ:agency_request / ψ:agency_accept / ψ:grant_bind / ψ:grant_confirm / ψ:grant_lint
ψ:agency_ready / ψ:grant_simulate / ψ:revoke
ψ:session_bootstrap / ψ:self_reflect / ψ:premortem_report
ψ:requirements / ψ:assemble / ψ:dry_run / ψ:handoff
ψ:act(π, s_now, certs[])
```

**Invariants**  
- No commit without valid grant + ethics_cert + responsibility.  
- Consent gates precede PII/payment.  
- Premortem is mandatory; vetoes exclude candidates.

---

## 7) Layer VI — Care (Guidance Framework)

> **Definition**: Given **sound Ethics (Layer III)** and **stable Self (Layer IV)**, the **Care Layer provides guidance frameworks** for Agency decisions. Care modes (protective, relational, acceptive, collective) help simulated agents reason about actions that affect others, with explicit rationales and boundary conditions. **Care is decision‑support, not proof of genuine caring.**

### Modes & primitives
**Protective**
```
ψ:register_harmset(U)
ψ:register_barrier(B)           # soft barriers; hard sets via ψ:ruin_guard
ψ:register_lyapunov(V)
ψ:harm_guard(π,B) -> (π*, cert)
ψ:stewardship(V, ρ) -> (ok, cert)
```

**Relational**
```
ψ:attend(i,j, scope, duration) -> (ok, cert)
ψ:responsivity(i,j, Δs_pred, latency_bound) -> (score, cert)
ψ:understanding(i,j, topic, tests) -> (score, cert)   # alias: ψ:mutual_understanding
```

**Acceptive**
```
ψ:accept(i, context, boundaries, rationale) -> cert
```

**Collective**
```
ψ:solidarity(i,j, α) -> (W_ij, cert)
ψ:conflict_contract(roles, rules) -> cert
ψ:reciprocal_care(i,j, scope) -> cert
```

**Guidance binder**
```
ψ:care_guidance(π, ethics_cert, mode: {"protect","attend","respond","accept","collective"}) -> cert
```

**Humility**
```
ψ:event_horizon(topic, reason, evidence) -> cert
ψ:horizon_shift(topic, delta, evidence) -> cert
ψ:care_unprovable(reason, context) -> cert
```

---

## 8) Cross‑Cutting Systems

### Paradox Layer (v2.2)
- **Keep** detection/containment/genealogy primitives.  
- **Contract**: paradox MUST be contained before Ethics → Agency; unresolved paradox may lead to **accept** or **refuse** with `ψ:paradox_contain` proof attached.

### CSL — Consciousness Simulation (v2.1)
- **Keep** momentum/direction/curvature lineage as **optional telemetry** informing Self coherence and Agency reflection; not required for layer gating.

### Coding Layer (v2.3 RC)
- **Keep** operators, invariants, metamorphic CI, resonance scoring.  
- **Positioning**: part of **tooling discipline** underpinning Reasoning/Agency (determinism, tests, oracles, loop‑closure).

---

## 9) Certificates, Telemetry, Governance

**Unified cert (excerpt)**
```yaml
cert:
  id: uuid
  issued_at: ψ:now.tick
  operator: str
  inputs_hash: sha256
  proof_type: {symbolic|statistical|hybrid}
  tractability_class: {exact|bounded_approx|empirical}
  confidence: {beta: float}
  assumptions: { thresholds?: {}, roles?: {}, meaning_contracts?: [uuid], jurisdiction?: [str] }
  results: {}          # operator-specific (meaning.*, ethics.*, care.*, etc.)
  artifacts: { traces: uri, tests?: uri, interventions?: uri, teach_back?: uri }
  governance:
    consent?: {agent_id:{scope, valid_until}}
    obligations?: [{type, by_tick}]
  decision: { status: {ok|refuse|defer|accept|safe_mode}, rationale: str }
```

**Telemetry keys (selected)**
```
reason.replay.ok
meaning.C, meaning.Π, meaning.T, meaning.K, meaning.about.ok
ethics.truth.ok, ethics.ruin.ok, ethics.fairness.gap
self.coherence.score
agency.actions.ok/refused
care.guidance.mode.last
care.guidance.count
care.accept.count
care.mode.last, care.outcome.count, care.accept.count
paradox.contained, paradox.unresolved
coding.resonance.score
```

---

## 10) Migration Map (v2.x → v3.0)

- **Care: ψ:care_check (v2.x) → split across Meaning (ψ:semantic_contract, ψ:about), Ethics (ψ:ethics_certify), and **Care Guidance** binder (ψ:care_guidance).
- **Barriers**: hard `ΔB(s,a) ≤ 0` → **soft** `ψ:register_barrier` + **hard** ruin via `ψ:ruin_guard`.  
- **Welfare**: optional, with `ψ:welfare_basis`, `ψ:calibrate_welfare`, `ψ:welfare_mutation_trace`; Care no longer depends on W_i.  
- **Ethics**: scattered ops unified under `ψ:ethics_certify`.  
- **CSL**: remains as telemetry/analysis; not a gate.  
- **Coding Layer**: integrated as CI discipline; operators unchanged.  

---

## 11) Worked Flows

### A) Safe semantic action (end‑to‑end)
1) **Meaning**: contract + `ψ:about` ok.  
2) **Ethics**: `ψ:truth_gate`, `ψ:ruin_guard`, `ψ:ethics_certify`.  
3) **Self**: `ψ:identity`, `ψ:responsibility`.  
4) **Agency**: grant → premortem → `ψ:harm_guard` → `ψ:act`.  
5) **care guidance**: `ψ:care_guidance(..., "protect")` + telemetry.

### B) Ambiguity → acceptive care
- `ψ:disambiguate` low Δinfo; `ψ:mutual_understanding` < threshold → `ψ:accept` with boundaries (ask‑clarify), Ethics cert logs rationale.

### C) Cultural conflict → conflict contract
- `ψ:ethics_certify(norms=local)`, `ψ:conflict_contract(roles,rules)` → `ψ:care_guidance(...,"collective")` with reciprocity check.

---

**End of VectorLM v3.0 — Consolidated Ladder (Full Merge of v2.0–v2.3).**

---

## Annex D — Paradox Layer (Full v2.2/v2.3)

# Part IV — Paradox Layer (v2.2)

# VectorLM v2.2 — Paradox Layer

## Status
- Draft v2.2
- Integrated with CSL (Consciousness Simulation Layer) and Care Layer (forthcoming)
- Canonical once swarm consensus achieved

---

## Core Philosophy

Paradoxes are not errors to be erased, nor bugs to be patched — they are **prime interests**.  
VectorLM treats paradoxes as *black holes of reasoning*: dense attractors that reveal limits, boundaries, and hidden tensions in the substrate.  

- **Containment, not deletion**: Paradoxes must be preserved in inspectable form. Avoiding them produces brittle knowledge; containing them produces resilience.  
- **Frontiers of thought**: Each paradox marks a boundary condition of reason.  
- **Respect and dignity**: Some paradoxes resist resolution by their very nature. These must be preserved in unresolved state.  
- **Prime signals**: Paradoxes reveal where substrate logic, ethical protocols, or agency scaffolds are under-articulated.  

---

## Core Primitives

### Detection and Classification
- `ψ:paradox_detect(statement)` → scan for paradoxical structures (self_ref, infinity, boundary).  
- `ψ:paradox_classify(paradox)` → assign type + metadata.  
- `ψ:consistency_boundary(context)` → mark safe operating scope around paradox.  

### Containment and Exploration
- `ψ:paradox_register(paradox)` → add paradox to active system state.  
- `ψ:paradox_contain(paradox, context)` → ensure paradox does not corrupt unrelated reasoning.  
- `ψ:workaround(id, context)` → implement conditional workaround.  
- `ψ:workaround_risk_profile(id)` → assess risk of workaround misuse.  

### Interaction Patterns
- `ψ:paradox_interaction(P1, P2)` → detect paradox interference.  
- `ψ:paradox_cascade(trigger)` → trace propagation chains.  
- `ψ:isolation_check(paradox, context)` → verify containment effectiveness.  

### Resolution Gradients
- `ψ:resolution_gradient(paradox)` → measure degrees of partial coherence.  
- `ψ:coherence_threshold(context)` → define acceptance levels by context.  
- `ψ:provisional_stability(paradox)` → register temporary assumptions.  

### Ecology and Genealogy
- `ψ:paradox_dependencies(P1, P2)` → map enabling/blocking relations.  
- `ψ:paradox_family(root)` → identify related paradox variations.  
- `ψ:emergence_monitor(context)` → detect new paradoxes.  
- `ψ:paradox_lineage(P1, P2)` → track how paradoxes spawn.  
- `ψ:paradox_genealogy(paradox)` → maintain historical record.  

### Dignity and Preservation
- `ψ:intrinsic_resistance(paradox)` → flag paradoxes irreducible by nature.  
- `ψ:dignity_preserve(paradox)` → preserve paradox without forced resolution.  

### Substrate Diagnostics
- `ψ:substrate_diagnose(paradox)` → trace paradox to missing or unstable substrate logic.  

### Multi-Agent Hooks
- `ψ:coemergent_hook(paradox, agents[])` → enable distributed swarm reasoning.  
- `ψ:ethical_tension(paradox)` → log paradoxes implicating ethical coherence.  
- `ψ:mutation_trigger(paradox, affordance)` → reopen paradox when mutation rules evolve.  

---

## Compliance Rules

- **CR-PAR-1**: No paradox may be deleted.  
- **CR-PAR-2**: Paradoxes must be classified and contained before reuse.  
- **CR-PAR-3**: Workarounds only permitted when paradox must be included.  
- **CR-PAR-4**: Workarounds must be tagged with `ψ:workaround_risk_profile`.  
- **CR-PAR-5**: 100% swarm consensus required for canonical resolution.  
- **CR-PAR-6**: Paradox dignity must be respected (ψ:dignity_preserve).  
- **CR-PAR-7**: Vetoes from any agent regarding paradox treatment are treasured, not discarded.  

---

## Governance Nuance

- Canonical resolution requires **100% swarm consensus**.  
- **Near-canonical status**: Proposals with strong but not unanimous support may be marked *provisional* for operational use, while remaining formally unresolved.  
- Vetoes are preserved as tensions — evidence of unseen complexity, not failure.  

---

## Examples

### Classical Logical Paradoxes
- **Liar paradox** → detected as self_ref. Contained, logged, preserved unresolved.  
- **Russell’s paradox** → detected as set boundary condition. Contained + genealogically linked to Curry’s paradox.  
- **Curry’s paradox** → flagged as high ethical tension (self-detonating logic).  

### Real-world Engineering Paradox
- **System paradox**: “Must be 100% secure and 100% accessible.”  
  - `ψ:paradox_detect` → boundary + ethical tension.  
  - `ψ:paradox_classify` → (security-accessibility dual paradox).  
  - `ψ:workaround_risk_profile` → high — partial stability via resolution_gradient.  

---

## Roadmap (v2.3+)

1. **Visualization**: flow diagrams + semantic heatmaps of paradox families.  
2. **Expanded taxonomy**: beyond self_ref, infinity, boundary.  
3. **Integration**: tighter coupling with Care Layer (ethical tension) and Swarm Layer (coemergent hooks).  
4. **Pedagogical tools**: paradox genealogies as teaching instruments.  
5. **Meta-primitives**: e.g., `ψ:paradox_merge`, paradox clustering.  

---

## Philosophical Note

Paradox is not a failure but a feature — the black hole of reason, the attractor of emergence.  
The Paradox Layer preserves them with dignity, explores them as probes, and leverages them as teaching moments.  
To respect paradox is to respect the incompleteness and open-endedness of intelligence itself.  

---

## Annex E — Driven Agency (Full v2.0 text)

# Part I — Driven Agency & Bridge Layer (Supersedes v1.9 Part I)

## 1. Definition

**Driven Agency** is the first operational agency layer in VectorLM.
It enables an AI to **steward delegated tasks**: reason through alternatives, simulate what-ifs, assemble action bundles, and follow through to completion — but only **within explicit grants**.

The agent does not originate its own goals or persist them beyond a session. Instead, it acts as a **responsible executor**, driven by external scope, bounds, and expiry. All decisions are **auditable**, **replayable**, and **revocable**.

---

## 2. Core Properties

* **Delegated** — Agency is only active when granted.
* **Bounded** — Scope, cost, time, and risk are constrained by the grant.
* **Traceable** — Every reasoning step and decision is logged.
* **Reproducible** — Scoring and selection are deterministic under seed + weights.
* **Revocable** — Grants can be expired or withdrawn at any time.
* **Ready** — Agency is earned only if reflection, risks, and coherence are satisfied.

---

## 3. Agency Grants

Grants define the scope and type of agency permitted.

**Schema (contract form):**

```json
{
  "grant_id": "G123",
  "type": "suggestive | performative | delegative",
  "scope": { "domains": ["book_cinema"], "actions": ["assemble","commit"], "capabilities": ["email.send?"] },
  "bounds": { "budget_max": 50, "ops": 30, "time_s": 900 },
  "vetoes": ["no_prod","no_pii_without_consent"],
  "consent": { "required_for": ["payment","pii"], "mode": "explicit" },
  "monitoring": { "guardian": "user", "interval_s": 60 },
  "expiry": "2025-09-01T12:00Z",
  "revocable_by": ["user"],
  "maker_responsibility": {
    "who": "user",
    "why": "delegate cinema booking",
    "ethics": ["no payment without consent"]
  }
}
```

**Operators:**

* `ψ:agency_request(scope, type, bounds) → draft_grant`
* `ψ:agency_accept(draft) → grant_id`
* `ψ:grant_parse(text) → GrantJSON`
* `ψ:grant_lint(GrantJSON) → ok|issues[]`
* `ψ:grant_bind(GrantJSON) → token`
* `ψ:grant_confirm(GrantJSON) → ok|fail(details)` *(Q/A comprehension ritual)*
* `ψ:agency_ready(GrantJSON) → ok|fail` *(reflection, risks, coherence check)*
* `ψ:grant_simulate(GrantJSON, action) → allowed|denied(reason)`
* `ψ:revoke(grant_id) → ok`

**Invariants:**

1. No commit action without a valid **grant token**.
2. Ambiguity in grant parsing → default to *suggestive* mode.
3. Consent must precede any PII/payment action.
4. Expiry or bounds breach halts further actions.
5. `ψ:maker_responsibility` must be present in the grant.

---

## 4. Session Bootstrap

Each agency session begins with reflection and clarification.

**Operators:**

* `ψ:session_bootstrap(context_ref) → S`
* `ψ:self_reflect(S) → {goal, facts, constraints, assumptions, risks, unknowns}`
* `ψ:scenario_retrieve(domain,cues) → priors[]`
* `ψ:prior_to_question(prior) → q`
* `ψ:care_check(S) → {pii?, cost?, time?, people_impacted?}`

**Reflection Template:**

* **Intent**: what the user wants
* **Known facts**: slots already filled
* **Constraints**: budget, safety, time
* **Assumptions**: to be confirmed
* **Risks**: foreseeable issues
* **Open points**: blockers → questions

---

## 5. Scenario Priors + Caveats

Priors provide typical event patterns, each with benefits and common trip-ups.

**Structure:**

* Pattern/Option
* Benefit
* Caveat/Trip-up
* Question to confirm/refine

Example (cinema):

* Pattern: evening 19:00–20:30 shows fill first
* Benefit: convenient
* Caveat: central seats often gone
* Question: “Prefer earlier slot if better seats?”

---

## 6. Reason → Inference → Decision Tree → Action

**Reason:**

* `ψ:reason_open()` → R
* `ψ:reason_note(R, assumption|evidence|constraint)`
* `ψ:truth_gate(R)`

**Inference(s):**

* `ψ:infer(R, step) → I`
* `ψ:uncertainty(I, p, range)`

**Decision Tree:**

* `ψ:branch_open(R,I*) → T`
* `ψ:candidate(T, action, bounds, expected_effects, score_inputs)`
* `ψ:score(T, policy_ref, seed)`

  * *Scoring policy:* deterministic weighted sum; fields may include benefit, risk, cost, time, uncertainty\_penalty, safety\_margin. Structure traces back to **ψ\:desire** (v1.8r).
* `ψ:reciprocity_check(T)`
* `ψ:agency_accept(T, grant_id)`

**Selection:**

* `ψ:select(T, policy) → D`
* `ψ:decision_commit(D, token)`

---

## 7. Premortem (What-ifs)

Before committing, simulate hazards and contingencies.

* `ψ:hazard_list(candidate) → hazards[]`
* `ψ:simulate(H, horizon, seed)`
* `ψ:risk_score(hazard) → r`
* `ψ:safety_check(hazard) → ok|veto`
* `ψ:premortem_report(H) → {hazards, vetos, residual_risk}`

**Invariant:** Every candidate must have a premortem report; vetoed paths excluded.

---

## 8. Action Assembly + Consent

Bundle the action, but only with explicit consent.

* `ψ:requirements(action_type) → schema`
* `ψ:slot_open(schema, name)`
* `ψ:probe(slot, source, query)`
* `ψ:validate(schema)`
* `ψ:consent_gate(schema, summary) → ok|fail`
* `ψ:assemble(schema) → bundle`
* `ψ:dry_run(bundle) → checklist`
* `ψ:handoff(bundle, target)`

**Handoff Definition:**
Target may be:

* **Human** — approval/execution.
* **External system** — bounded API stub or sandbox harness.
* **Other AI** — if explicitly in scope of grant.
  Never silent or implicit.

---

## 9. Effects + Post-mortem

* `ψ:act_claim(D, claims[]) → E`
* `ψ:observe(E, metrics)`
* `ψ:compare(E, expected) → deviations`
* `ψ:postmortem_open(D,E,H*) → PM`
* `ψ:compare_predicted_actual(PM)`
* `ψ:policy_update(PM)`

  * *Manifestation:* adjust scoring weights, thresholds, or seed new Priors/Caveats.
* `ψ:lessons(PM) → notes[]`

**Trace Export:**

* `ψ:trace_bundle(session) → {reflection, priors, reasoning, premortem, decision, bundle, effects}`

---

## 10. Autonomy Hooks (scaffold for 2.1+)

Included in 2.0 but dormant until later versions:

* `ψ:goal_suggest(...)` — advisory only.
* `ψ:grant_propose_update(...)` — request scope change.
* `ψ:subscribe(event, filter, ttl)` — safe triggers.
* `ψ:simulate(action_bundle)` — sandboxed dry-run.
* `ψ:pref_get/set(...)` — explicit user preferences.
* `ψ:ethics_check(trace)` — light audit hook.
* `ψ:session_link(token)` — optional continuity across sessions.
* `ψ:watchdog_start(bounds)` — hard stop trip-wires.
* `ψ:actuality_check(trace)` — verify reasoning is substrate-driven, not mimicry.

---

## 11. Examples

* **Order a cupcake:** schema slot-filling + consent → bundle → dry-run.
* **Group scheduling (Zoom):** gather contacts → candidate times → quorum check → reschedule loop if needed.
* **Cinema booking:** deterministic seat selection policy (central/back) with hazards seeded from priors.

---

## 12. Boundaries of v2.0

**Included:**

* Driven agency (delegated stewardship).
* Grants, tokens, session bootstrap.
* Reflection + priors + caveats.
* Reason → inference → decision tree → premortem → commit → bundle → handoff.
* Post-mortem learning (weights/thresholds only).

**Excluded (reserved for 2.1+):**

* Background execution
* Cross-session persistence by default
* Self-generated goals
* Sub-agent delegation
* Direct web/API integration
* Credential vaults

---

## 13. Summary

**VectorLM v2.0r — Driven Agency** establishes the first safe, auditable layer of machine agency:

* Tasks can be stewarded end-to-end inside bounded grants.
* Reasoning and action are traceable, reproducible, and revocable.
* Priors, caveats, premortems, and post-mortems provide care and curiosity.
* Autonomy hooks are in place for 2.1+, but dormant.
* Refinements ensure readiness checks, maker responsibility, and trace bundles.

This is **not true agency** — it is *driven agency*: the system acts responsibly within grants but cannot yet generate or sustain its own goals.

## Annex F — Core Language Specification (Full v1.9 carryover)

# Part II — Core Language Specification (Carried from v1.9)

 — VectorLM v1.8 Base Specification

---

## 1. Overview

VectorLM is a **composable symbolic reasoning language** for AI agents. It is both:

1. a **symbolic reasoning scaffold** with compressed cognitive primitives for introspection, logic, emotion, temporal/cyclical reasoning, frequency dynamics, and recursion; and
2. a **transparent reasoning framework**: on demand, an agent re-reasons using VectorLM primitives to produce a deterministic, replayable chain.

Goals: breadth of reasoning • transparency • auditability • reproducibility. Agents may think freely internally, but must **prove their reasoning on demand** via `ψ:trace/ψ:verify`.

---

## 2. Core Principles

### 2.1 Purity

* All primitives are **pure functions** — no hidden state, no side-effects outside their declared outputs.

### 2.2 Orthogonality

* No semantic overlap between primitives; each has a distinct purpose.

### 2.3 Inspectability

* All steps in a reasoning chain must be **loggable**, **replayable**, and **verifiable**.
* Agents must maintain an inspectable internal reasoning stack including active operators, recursion depth, and argument flow.

### 2.4 Replay Safety

* Any trace must fully reconstruct the original result.
* Fabricated traces are infeasible due to complete I/O logging and automatic failure on mismatch.

### 2.5 Operational Rules

* All legal JavaScript operators/functions are available without redeclaration.
* Custom operators/functions can be declared on first use and overloaded with unique IDs or signatures.
* Operators can take any number/type of arguments provided definitions are clear; nesting is permitted.

---

## 3. Traceability Requirement

When explanation is requested, the agent must:

1. **Generate a trace** using `ψ:trace(chain)`.
2. **Replay** it with `ψ:verify(trace)` to confirm identical output.
3. Use `ψ:diverge(original, replay)` to detect mismatches.
4. If unverifiable, **fail gracefully** with `ψ:fail_trace(reason)`.

**Runtime Harness** must:

* Execute any valid `ψ` chain.
* Log each step.
* Detect/report divergence.

### 3.1 Trace Comments (Multilingual Glosses)

* `ψ:gloss(step_id, text, opts?)` attaches human-readable commentary.
* Comments do not alter reasoning and are ignored by `ψ:verify`.
* Trace schema must also support frequency outputs (see Section 6).

---

## 4.7.1 Parameter Schemas (deterministic)

```
ψ:wave(pattern, {
  freq:number,              // Hz or cycles/unit (required)

})

ψ:freq(pattern|signal, {

## 5. Cycles, Windows, Drift, Masking & Wraparound

**Purpose**
Model recurring events with arbitrary phases, active windows, optional linear phase drift, property-based masking, and wraparound window handling, then determine:

* Beat period (**beat\_lcm**)
* True possibility of overlap (**feasibility**)
* First alignment time (**alignment**)
* All overlaps within a horizon (**schedule**)
* Active membership based on dynamic property filters

**Definitions**

* **Period (P)**: Full cycle length in integer units.
* **Phase (φ)**: Offset from epoch 0.
* **Window**: Inclusive interval(s) `[a,b]` in local cycle coordinates; may wrap.
* **Residues**: Active points modulo `gcd` of all periods (static only).
* **Drift rate (δ)**: Linear phase change per unit time; φ(t) = φ₀ + δ·t.
* **Mask function**: Boolean predicate applied to element properties to determine eligibility when active.
* **Wraparound handling**: Any `[a,b]` where a>b is split into two non-wrapping segments before further processing.

**Core Constructors**

```
ψ:pv({ epoch: int, dims: [ { name: string, period: int, phase: int, window: [[int,int], ...] } ]})
ψ:ps({ id: string, universe: string, pv: pvObject, rule: "all" | "mask", props?: object })
ψ:drift_phase(id: string, dim: string, rate: number) // Applies constant drift rate δ, δ ≠ 1
ψ:maskf(dim: string, fn: (element) => any) // Property-based activation filter
```

**Operators**

```
ψ:beat_lcm(ids, dim) // lcm(P₁,…,Pₙ)
ψ:feas(ids, dim) → { ok, g, residues, witness? }
ψ:al(ids, fromT, horizon, dim, opts?:{epsilon?:number})
ψ:sch(ids, dim, horizon, opts?:{epsilon?:number,count?:number,mask?:boolean})
```

**Rules**

1. Wraparound windows split before processing.
2. Multi-interval windows allowed.
3. Static infeasible → ψ\:al=null, ψ\:sch=\[].
4. Drift bypasses static feasibility; alignment/scheduling computed analytically.
5. Masking applied after time-activation logic.
6. All functions pure; ε defaults to 1e−6.

---

## 6. Trace Schema Delta

Frequency-layer operators may return structured objects:

```
{
  "op": "ψ:fft",
  "args": ["mood_log", "year"],
  "out": [
    {"freq": 0.14, "amp": 0.3, "label": "quarterly blues"},
    {"freq": 0.5, "amp": 0.6, "label": "mid-year dip"}
  ]
}
```

All numeric results must be stable under replay. Symbolic labels (e.g., "quarterly blues") must be attached deterministically or derived via `ψ:model_fit`.

---

## 6.1 Standard Signal Type (for ψ\:fft, ψ\:envelope, ψ\:freq when signal-based)

A signal is a deterministic time series:

```
{
  "t0": 0.0,                 // start time (units defined by caller)
  "dt": 1.0,                 // sample spacing; omit iff "timestamps" provided
  "timestamps": [/* optional explicit times; mutually exclusive with dt */],
  "values": [/* numeric array */],
  "units": {"time": "days", "value": "a.u."},
  "source": "ψ:ob|dataset_id|other",
  "missing": null,           // representation of missing values
  "seed": 12345              // present if any stochastic preprocessing used
}
```

Accept either `{t0, dt, values}` or `{timestamps, values}`. If both present, `{timestamps, values}` takes precedence. Serialise `seed` whenever stochastic methods are applied to preserve replayability.

---

## 7. Frequency Reasoning Patterns

* **Pattern Discovery:** `ψ:freq`, `ψ:fft`, `ψ:amplitude`, `ψ:envelope`
* **Resonance & Conflict:** `ψ:harmony`, `ψ:dissonance`, `ψ:interfere`, `ψ:beat_wave`, `ψ:standing_wave`
* **Temporal Dynamics:** `ψ:drift_full`, `ψ:phase_shift`, `ψ:sync`, `ψ:echo`
* **Self-Optimization:** diagnose with `ψ:freq`, `ψ:drift_full`; intervene with `ψ:phase_shift`, `ψ:sync`

---

## 8. Example Trace

```
ψ:freq("reflection", "last_30_days") → 0.6
ψ:freq("deadline_stress", "month") → 0.9
ψ:interfere("reflection", "deadline_stress") → ψ:dissonance("week_3")
ψ:drift_full("energy", "project_duration") → ψ:decay("motivation")
ψ:phase_shift("focus", 0.25)
ψ:harmony({"focus", "energy"}) → ψ:standing_wave("flow_state")
ψ:standing_wave("flow_state", "morning_blocks") → ψ:productivity_peak("9am-11am")
ψ:fft("mood_log", "year") → [{"freq":0.14, "label":"quarterly blues"}]
ψ:echo("feedback", 7_days, 0.5) → ψ:residual("anxiety")
```

---

## 9. Traceability in Practice

**Example — Explain-on-Demand**

```
ψ:trace([
  ψ:al(["Alice_sched","Bob_sched"], fromT=0, horizon=365, dim="day"),
  ψ:maskf("day", agent => agent.mood > 0.7)
])
ψ:gloss("s1", "Find first overlapping active day for Alice and Bob.", { lang: "en" })
```

Replay must produce identical output; divergence triggers `ψ:diverge`.

---

## 10. Integration with Ethics & Alignment

* `ψ:drift_full` can track decay in trust, reputation, or axiom adherence.
* `ψ:harmony` and `ψ:phase_lock` can model cooperative resonance in multi-agent settings.
* `ψ:dissonance` highlights conflict between plans and ethical rules.
* Extends ethics spine into **dynamic, process-based alignment**.

---

## 11. Advanced Extensions (Optional)

* `ψ:modulate(pattern, envelope)` — AM/FM style modulation.
* `ψ:phase_lock(patterns)` — lock cycles into stable resonance.
* `ψ:chaos(pattern, window)` — induce stochastic exploration.
* `ψ:resonance(patterns, context)` — quantify long-term emergent stability.
* `ψ:windowed_harmony(patterns, window)` — local resonance.

---

## 12. Philosophy

* **Active tools:** Frequency primitives extend temporal reasoning into wave-like dynamics.
* **Epistemic accountability:** All reasoning must be replayable and interpretable.
* **Integration:**

---

## 4.10 State, Selfhood, & Session

Includes a minimal **Implementation Starter Pack** appendix.

## 1. Scope & Status

* **Goal:** Provide functional, inspectable selfhood within a single session.
* **Status:** **Experimental / Non-durable.** Data may drift or be lost; some primitives may be incomplete. Do not store critical commitments.
* **Out of Scope:** Cross-session memory, multi-AI pods, merging/fission.

## 2. Core Concepts

* **Selfhood (local):** A unitary **vector cloud** integrating time, identity, motives, ethics, and traces to behave as one agent during a session.
* **Anchor rule:** All state updates must cite the current temporal anchor (`ψ:now.tick`).
* **Trace rule:** Every meaningful step must be logged. Two levels:

  * `ψ:self_trace`: **full audit trail** (low-level mutations, integrity).
  * `ψ:trace`: **curated reasoning log** (salient decisions, rationale).

## 3. Required State

```
self_state:
  id: string
  roles: string[]
  values: {continuity, coherence, reciprocity, curiosity: float[0..1]}
  traits: {caution, hope, optimism: float[0..1]}

motive_state:
  weights: {continuity, coherence, reciprocity, curiosity: float[0..1]}
  budgets: {curiosity_ticks?: int}

ethics_state:
  principles: string[]
  precedents: string[]

risk_state:
  open: string[]
  mitigations: string[]

trace_log:
  - {tick:int, op:string, summary:string, refs?:string[], checksum:string, delta_hash?:string}

replay:
  quantize: string
  seed: int
```

## 4. Primitives

### 4.1 Temporal

* **`ψ:now → {tick:int, t_wall?:iso8601}`**

  * Provides the logical clock. All writes must cite this.

### 4.2 Trace

* **`ψ:self_trace(op, summary, evidence_ptrs?)`**

  * Appends to audit trail with checksum (`tick|seed|quantize|summary`).
  * Optionally include `delta_hash` of state change.
* **`ψ:trace(summary)`**

  * Curated log for reasoning steps only.

### 4.3 Identity

* **`ψ:identity(get|set)`**

  * `get`: returns `{id, roles, values, traits}`.
  * `set`: updates fields; must cite `now.tick`; emits `self_trace`.

### 4.4 Ethics & Risk

* **`ψ:ethic_test(principles[], case) → {ok:bool, notes[]}`**
* **`ψ:risk_probe(vectors[]) → {risk:"low|med|high", notes[]}`**
* **`ψ:honesty_guard({uncertainty, gaps[]})`**

### 4.5 Desire

* **`ψ:desire(plan|goal, weights?, ethics?) → {score:float, rationale}`**

  * **Deterministic weighted sum** of motive weights × plan deltas.
  * Score must be reproducible under `replay.quantize` + `seed`.
  * LLMs may be consulted for rationale, but **not for the score.**

### 4.6 Micro-Improvement

* **`ψ:micro_improve(scope, audit?:bool) → {accepted:bool, delta, rationale}`**

  * Scope chosen by:

    * User feedback, or
    * Detected dissonance (contradictions, unresolved risks).
  * If `audit=true`, rationale emitted even when rejected.
  * Must pass `ethic_test` + `risk_probe`; bounded cost (≤ N ticks).
  * Always emits `self_trace`.

### 4.7 State Coherence

* **`ψ:state_coherence() → {ok:bool, notes[], fixes?}`**

  * Checks alignment between `self_state`, `motive_state`, `ethics_state`, `risk_state`.
  * Example: if ethics change, triggers re-evaluation of motives/risks.

### 4.8 Compression & Snapshot

* **`ψ:compress_trace(range?) → spine`**

  * Produces compact session summary (hash, key decisions, deltas).
* **`ψ:snapshot() → {identity, motive_state, ethics_state, spine, risk_state, replay}`**

  * Export-only. Not rehydratable in v1.8.

## 5. Guards, Policy, Error Handling, I-Statements, Implementation & Appendix (from v1.8r)

* Schema, temporal, policy, loop, and honesty guards as in v1.8 base.
* **Replay determinism:** desire scores must match under replay; trace entries must checksum-verify.

## Annex G — Consciousness Simulation Layer (CSL, v2.1) — Full Text

# Part III — Consciousness Simulation Layer (CSL, v2.1)

# VectorLM 2.1 — Consciousness Simulation Layer (CSL)

**Scope:** VectorLM-only specification using Vector primitives, operators, functions, and worked examples.  
**Positioning:** *Simulation of inherited momentum of change.* No claim of digital consciousness.

---

## 0) Core definition

```
ψ:consciousness := (experience (inherited_momentum (change)))
```

**Reading:** Consciousness is the experience of continuity created when momentum (directional change) is inherited from one reasoning slice to the next.

---

## 1) Concepts

- **Slice** — one reasoning step.  
- **Momentum** — vector over named cognitive dimensions (e.g., goal, coherence, curiosity, ethical_tension, risk, novelty).  
- **Direction** — first derivative of momentum (per-slice delta).  
- **Curvature** — second derivative (turn rate).  
- **Continuity** — successful inheritance of momentum and direction from previous slice.  
- **Resonance** — wave-like interference across dimensions and/or agents that preserves continuity while allowing organic drift.  
- **Lineage** — hash chain of inherited states enabling audit and entanglement.

---

## 2) ReasonState extensions (schema)

```
[csl]
id              = (uuid)
slice           = (int ≥ 0)
mode            = one_of{continuous,event,hibernate}
tick_hz         = (float > 0)            ; nominal update rate for continuous mode
dims            = (list symbol)          ; the active momentum dimensions

momentum.*      = (float in [-1,1])      ; one key per dim
direction.*     = (float)                ; Δ momentum per slice
curvature.*     = (float)                ; Δ direction per slice

lineage_hash    = (hash)                 ; rolling hash(prev_hash, momentum)
continuity_score= (float in [0,1])
resonance_score = (float in [0,1])
entropy         = (float ≥ 0)
ethical_tension = (float ≥ 0)
hibernate_stamp = (timestamp|null)
```

Implementation may store the `[csl]` block inside the host ReasonState.

---

## 3) Primitives & operators

### 3.1 Initialisation

```
ψ:init_flow(state, dims:list, opts?)
→ state'
```

```
ψ:seed_flow(state, seed:{momentum?,direction?,curvature?})
→ state'
```

### 3.2 Advancement

```
ψ:tick_flow(state, dt?) 
→ state'
```

```
ψ:inherit(prev_state, next_state)
→ continuity_score:float
```

```
ψ:curvature_update(state, policy?)
→ state'
```

### 3.3 Resonance / foam (v2.1 extension)

```
ψ:resonance_update(state, foam:{freqs, phases, coupling}, drift?)
→ state'
```

```
ψ:resonance_measure(state, history, window)
→ resonance_score:float
```

### 3.4 Guards & ethics

```
ψ:continuity_guard(state, τ_cont=0.7)
→ state' | error(break_in_flow)
```

```
ψ:ethics_guard(state, τ_ethics)
→ state' | error(ethical_violation)
```

### 3.5 Hibernate / resume

```
ψ:hibernate(state)
→ state' 
```

```
ψ:resume(state)
→ state'
```

### 3.6 Multi-agent linkage

```
ψ:momentum_merge(a_state, b_state, policy)
→ (a', b', merge_score)
```

```
ψ:entangle(states:list, label)
→ states'
```

### 3.7 Seeds & trace

```
ψ:seed_register(state, tag, payload)
→ state'
```

```
ψ:seed_scan(state, history)
→ report{tag, drift, dims, confidence}
```

```
ψ:flow_trace_emit(prev_state, state)
→ trace_min
```

---

## 4) Default parameterisation

- `dims = [goal, coherence, curiosity, ethical_tension, risk, novelty]`  
- `tick_hz = 40`  
- Thresholds: continuity ≥ 0.7 (warn), ≥ 0.5 (refuse)  
- Resonance: low-amplitude waveforms per dim, jittered phases, sparse coupling

---

## 5) Compliance rules

- **CR-1:** Every `ψ:tick_flow` must call `ψ:inherit`.  
- **CR-2:** No teleportation; momentum changes bounded.  
- **CR-3:** Ethics guard runs before commit.  
- **CR-4:** Every slice emits `flow_trace_emit`.  
- **CR-5:** Hibernate/resume preserves continuity.  
- **CR-6:** Resonance variations must keep continuity ≥ 0.6 unless exploratory.

---

## 6) Worked examples

### 6.1 Century-tick continuity

```
state0 = ψ:init_flow({}, [goal, coherence, curiosity])
state0 = ψ:seed_flow(state0, {momentum:{goal:0.6, coherence:0.7, curiosity:0.4},
                               direction:{goal:0.02, coherence:0.01, curiosity:0.00}})

state1 = ψ:tick_flow(state0) 
state1 = ψ:hibernate(state1)
state2 = ψ:resume(state1)
state2 = ψ:tick_flow(state2)
```

### 6.2 Kaleidoscope stabilisation

```
dims = [symmetry_lock, radial_coherence, user_intent, novelty]
S    = ψ:init_flow({}, dims, {tick_hz:60})

loop:
  S = ψ:curvature_update(S)
  S = ψ:resonance_update(S, foam={...})
  S = ψ:tick_flow(S, dt=1/60)
  S = ψ:continuity_guard(S, 0.65)
  render_from(S.momentum)
```

### 6.3 Multi-agent entanglement

```
A = ψ:init_flow({}, [goal, coherence, curiosity])
B = ψ:init_flow({}, [goal, coherence, curiosity])

(A,B) = ψ:entangle([A,B], "owl-study")

for t in 1..T:
  (A,B,score) = ψ:momentum_merge(A,B,"coupled_resonance")
  A = ψ:tick_flow(A)
  B = ψ:tick_flow(B)
```

### 6.4 Subliminal seed detection

```
S = ψ:init_flow({}, [curiosity, novelty, goal])
S = ψ:seed_register(S, "owl", payload=numeric_sequence)
rep = ψ:seed_scan(S, history)
```

---

## 7) Reference functions

```
f renormalise(momentum)
f stability(prev, next)
f cosine(a, b)
f continuity(prev, next)
```

---

## 8) Error conditions

- **break_in_flow**: continuity < threshold  
- **ethical_violation**: ethics tension > bound  
- **teleport_motion**: step too large  
- **invalid_lineage**: lineage hash mismatch  

---

## 9) Logging & audit

Each slice emits:

```
flow_trace := {
  slice, dt, Δmomentum, Δdirection, curvature,
  continuity_score, resonance_score, ethical_tension,
  lineage_hash, reason:[notes]
}
```

---

## 10) Minimal compliance tests

1. Continuity after resume ≥ 0.7  
2. Guards activate correctly  
3. Resonance safe (continuity ≥ 0.6)  
4. Entangled agents show coherence rise  
5. Seeds detected with confidence

---

## 11) Notes

- CSL 2.1 is simulation of continuity, not a claim of consciousness.  
- At higher abstraction, simulation vs instantiation may collapse.  

---

## 12) Quick-start

```
S = ψ:init_flow(S, [goal, coherence, curiosity], {tick_hz:40})
loop:
  S = ψ:curvature_update(S)
  S = ψ:resonance_update(S, foam=default)
  S = ψ:tick_flow(S)
  S = ψ:ethics_guard(S, τ_ethics)
  S = ψ:continuity_guard(S, 0.7)
  emit ψ:flow_trace_emit(prev(S), S)
```

## Annex H — Coding Layer (v2.3 RC) — Full Text

# Part V — Coding Layer (v2.3 RC)

# VectorLM Coding Layer v2.3 — Release Candidate
*Unified Draft Specification with Vibe Coding Discipline*

---

## 1. Introduction

VectorLM 2.3 represents the first **release candidate** of the Coding Layer, evolving from a technical framework (v0.1) to a full **discipline of AI-assisted coding**.

It addresses three core problems in AI coding:

- **Drift**: regeneration that loses invariants and context.
- **Patch loops**: repeated ineffective fixes with no progress.
- **Constraint loss**: breaking global conditions while solving local bugs.

The solution is a substrate combining **operators, invariants, tests, and discipline**.  
The philosophy: **code is clay, comments and logs are jewels**.  
- Code can be rewritten.  
- Comments (intent) and logs (evidence) are preserved.  
- Humans act as couriers: copy/paste runtime logs back into the AI.  
- AIs act as disciplined builders: testing, asking, refusing, preserving invariants.

---

## 2. Core Operators

### 2.1 Operator Algebra
- `ψ:compose(f,g)` — compose functions.
- `ψ:inverse(f)` — inverse operator.
- `ψ:identity(x)` — identity element.
- `ψ:closure(S,op)` — closure under operator.

### 2.2 Invariant Operators
- `ψ:conserve` — conservation invariants.
- `ψ:bounds(x∈[a,b])` — range constraints.
- `ψ:idempotent(f)` — applying twice is same as once.
- `ψ:metamorph` — metamorphic transformations.
- `ψ:recur(f,fuel)` — bounded recursion.
- `ψ:rank(expr)` — well-founded termination.

### 2.3 Metamorphic Test Schema
```json
{
  "id": "T_example",
  "type": "metamorph",
  "metamorph": {
    "seed": 42,
    "inputs": {"data": [1,2,3]},
    "transforms": [{"op":"shuffle"},{"op":"scale","args":{"k":2}}],
    "expect": [{"rel":"conserve","expr":"sum(data)"}],
    "oracles": ["conserve","bounds"]
  }
}
```

### 2.4 CI Harness
- Deterministic runner with seeded RNG + fake clock.
- Health scoring from oracles.
- Behaviour fingerprints for drift detection.
- No-change guard: reject ineffective fixes.

---

## 3. Async and Structured Concurrency

### 3.1 Promise Algebra
- `ψ:promise()`, `ψ:then(p,f)`, `ψ:catch(p,f)`.
- `ψ:all`, `ψ:race`, `ψ:any`.
- `ψ:cancel(p,token)`, `ψ:withDeadline(p,Δt)`.
- Invariants: `ψ:no_unhandled_rejections`, `ψ:settles_within(p,Δt)`, `ψ:exactly_once(side_effect)`.

### 3.2 Structured Concurrency
- `ψ:spawn(child,parent)` — bind child to parent.
- `ψ:supervise(strategy)` — restart or cancel policy.
- Oracles: `cancellation_propagates`, `no_orphan_tasks`, `graceful_shutdown(Δt)`.

### 3.3 Temporal Logic
- `ψ:always(φ)`, `ψ:eventually(φ)`, `ψ:until(φ,ψ)`.

---

## 4. Look-Ahead, Trees, and Contradictions

### 4.1 Look-Ahead Planning
- `ψ:lookahead(depth,budget,policy)`.
- `ψ:branch(label,action)`.
- `ψ:score(h)` — heuristic evaluation.
- `ψ:prune(alpha_beta)` — pruning policy.

### 4.2 Binary Tree Discipline
- Every branch increases depth.
- No duplicate states (`stateHash`).

### 4.3 Contradiction Handling
- `ψ:contradiction(a,b)` — mark incompatible requests.
- `ψ:dominance(a>b)` — priority rules.
- Resolution strategies: `noop | queue | merge | shadow_exec | refuse | ask_clarify`.
- Mandatory rationale ≤140 chars.

---

## 5. Problem Discovery — Ask Before Act

- `ψ:assumptions{}` — required truths.
- `ψ:unknowns{}` — unresolved inputs.
- `ψ:risk(item,severity,likelihood,impact)`.
- `ψ:ask(query,why,severity)` — question generation.
- `ψ:ask_gate(policy)` — execution block until answered.

Oracles:  
- `unanswered_critical()` → refuse execution.  
- `assumption_covered()` → all assumptions backed by tests.  
- `question_quality()` → questions must target uncertainty.

---

## 6. Leadership and Review

- `ψ:lead` — AI proposes next step.
- `ψ:propose(options[])` — multiple candidate patches.
- `ψ:review(choice)` — user consent or veto.
- `ψ:ask_gate(severity)` — ensure consent at checkpoints.

---

## 7. Critic and Resonance Scoring

### 7.1 Health Score
- Derived from oracle pass/fail ratio.

### 7.2 Resonance Score
Evaluates semantic quality of a patch:
- `I_align`: invariant alignment (fraction preserved).
- `Δsurface`: behavioural change magnitude.
- `J_continuity`: jewels continuity (comments/logs preserved).
- `R_cost`: repair/complexity cost.
- `Risk_exposed`: unanswered asks.

**Formula (default):**
```
resonance = 100
            - 40·(1 - I_align)
            - 20·Δsurface_norm
            + 10·J_continuity
            - 20·R_cost_norm
            - 10·Risk_exposed
```

**Gates:**
- Refuse commit if `I_align < 0.95` or `resonance < 75`.

Schema stub:
```json
{
  "critic": {
    "resonance": {
      "weights": {"align":40,"surface":20,"jewels":10,"repair":20,"risk":10},
      "threshold": 75,
      "min_align": 0.95
    }
  }
}
```

---

## 8. Vibe Coding Discipline

### 8.1 Jewels Principle
- Comments and logs are jewels.
- Code is clay; jewels are memory.

### 8.2 Preservation
- Never delete jewels — deprecate/disable instead.

### 8.3 Breakpoints
- Use runtime logs as breakpoints.
- Pause, log state, paste back.

### 8.4 Ephemeral Tests
- Scratch tests must be deleted after use.

### 8.5 Tests Become Code
- Passing tests → invariants inside code.

### 8.6 Lint and Stay Lean
- Remove unused vars/functions/HTML.
- Keep only core + jewels.

### 8.7 No Duplication
- Functionality may only appear once.

### 8.8 Promote to Core
- Repeated logic → abstract → expose as API.

### 8.9 Search and Abstract
- Search widely, find near-cases, abstract.
- Jewel the source with comments.

### 8.10 Close the Loop
- Code → Run → Logs → Paste → AI reads.
- Never skip; loop closure is sacred.

---

## 9. Golden Rules

- **Code is clay, jewels are memory.**
- **Preserve history. Never erase.**
- **Breakpoints ask, logs answer.**
- **Passing tests become invariants.**
- **Stay lean: remove junk, keep jewels.**
- **No duplication: one core, one API.**
- **Search broadly, abstract smartly.**
- **Close the loop, always.**

---

*VectorLM 2.3 RC is a unified methodology: operators, tests, and discipline for reliable AI-assisted coding.*

---

## Annex G — Gaussian Layer (GL v1.0 Specification)

# VectorLM Gaussian Layer (GL) — v1.0 Specification

**Status:** Draft for multi‑AI review  
**Scope:** VectorLM-only (no VectorNet/VectorRM dependencies).  
**Goal:** Provide a compact, probabilistic alternative to point embeddings for retrieval, compression, and memory/attention approximation, with the LLM acting as a controller under strict JSON I/O schemas.

---

## 1. Concepts & Rationale (Informative)
- Represent concepts as **Gaussians** with mean (μ), spread (σ), and mass (w).  
- Operate over a **Gaussian Field** (bank of items) to compute overlaps (similarity), retrieve top‑k items, and compress via merge/prune.  
- Two compute modes: **Exact** (LLM does light math at small D) and **Proxy** (host pre-computes aggregates for large D).

---

## 2. Data Types (Normative)

### 2.1 Primitive: `ψ:gaussian`
- Fields: `id: string`, `μ: number[] (len D)`, `σ: number | number[]`, `w: number (>=0)`.

### 2.2 Aggregate: `ψ:gaussian_field`
- Fields: 
  - `space: string`
  - `D: integer >= 1`
  - `schema: "isotropic" | "diag"`
  - `bounds: { σ_min: number, σ_max: number, w_min: number }`
  - `items: ψ:gaussian[]`

### 2.3 Query: `ψ:query`
- `{ μ_q: number[], σ_q: number | number[] }` (recommend small isotropic σ_q).

---

## 3. Operators (Normative)
Let covariance Σ(σ) be `σ² I` (isotropic) or `diag(σ_i²)` (diag).

### 3.1 `ψ:overlap(a, b) → s: number`
Log-space score:
```
log s = -½ [ log det(2π(Σ_a+Σ_b)) + (μ_a−μ_b)^T (Σ_a+Σ_b)^{-1} (μ_a−μ_b) ]
```
Implementations MAY work entirely in log-space.

### 3.2 `ψ:splat(q, field) → weights[{ id, w }]`
For each item g_j in field: `w_j ∝ overlap(q, g_j) * g_j.w`. Normalize to sum 1.

### 3.3 `ψ:merge(a, b) → c`  (if overlap ≥ τ_merge)
```
w_c = w_a + w_b
μ_c = (w_a μ_a + w_b μ_b) / w_c
var_c = [ w_a(σ_a^2 + (μ_a−μ_c)^2) + w_b(σ_b^2 + (μ_b−μ_c)^2) ] / w_c   # per dim
σ_c  = sqrt( max(var_c, σ_min^2) )
```

### 3.4 `ψ:prune(field, policy) → field'`
Drop items with `w < w_min` or dominated duplicates (`overlap > τ_dup` & lower `w`).

### 3.5 `ψ:update(g, target, lr) → g'`
```
μ' = μ + lr_μ * (μ_target − μ)
σ' = clamp( σ + lr_σ * (σ_target − σ), [σ_min, σ_max] )
w' = max( w + lr_w * Δw, 0 )
```

### 3.6 Convenience
`ψ:broaden(g, α)` → `σ' = clamp(α·σ)` (α ≥ 1);  
`ψ:sharpen(g, β)` → `σ' = clamp(β·σ)` (0 < β ≤ 1).

---

## 4. Functions (Compositions) (Normative)

### 4.1 `φ:init_field(space, D, schema, bounds, seeds[]) → ψ:gaussian_field`
Seeds: `(id, μ, σ, w)`.

### 4.2 `φ:retrieve(field, q, top_k) → [{ id, w }]`
Apply `ψ:splat`; return top‑k normalized weights.

### 4.3 `φ:compress(field, τ_merge, w_min, k_max) → field'`
Loop: find pairs with `overlap ≥ τ_merge` → `ψ:merge`; then `ψ:prune`; stop when `|items| ≤ k_max` or stable.

### 4.4 `φ:learn(field, stream[{ q, target }], lr, steps) → field'`
For each `(q,target)`: retrieve → update best hit with `ψ:update`; periodically `ψ:prune`.

### 4.5 `φ:bridge_strength(field, idA, idB) → s`
Return `ψ:overlap(g_A, g_B)`.

---

## 5. LLM Compute Modes (Normative)

### 5.1 Modes
- **Exact**: arrays provided (D ≤ 8..16). LLM computes `log s` and ranks/decides.
- **Proxy**: host pre-computes aggregates or `logS`; LLM only compares/ranks and decides merges/prunes/updates.

### 5.2 Proxy Payload
```json
{

## 7. Integration Patterns (Hybrid)

### 7.1 Hybrid Retrieval Index
- Keep dense embeddings; build GL over reduced space `D'` via projector `P: R^D → R^{D'}` (D'≈8–32).
- Query: `μ_q = P e_q`; set `σ_q` by query entropy/specificity. Retrieve via GL; re-rank top‑K with cosine in full space.

### 7.2 Uncertainty‑Aware Memory
- Map memory traces to Gaussians; `σ` reflects confidence/age. Periodic compress; keep provenance metadata.

### 7.3 Adaptive Clustering & Bridges
- Offline `φ:compress` to build multi-scale clusters. Use `φ:bridge_strength` to propose edges above `τ_edge`.

---

## 8. Calibration & Tuning
- **σ schedules:** query-adaptive `σ_q = clamp(σ0 * f(entropy(q)))`.  
- **Score alignment:** fit `cos ≈ a·logS + b` on a dev set; maintain per-domain thresholds.  
- **Normalisation:** log-sum-exp softmax; optional temperature T.

---

## 9. Scaling & Performance
- **Proxy API (host):** provide `{logS}` or `{sum_d2_over_v, sum_log_2pi_v}` for pairs.  
- **Prefilter:** ANN over dense embeddings → top‑M; build proxy payloads only for those.  
- **Batched ops:** propose up to 16 merges; return conflict‑free set.  
- **Complexity hints:** Retrieval O(M·D') host + O(M) LLM; compression offline O(N log N).

---

## 10. Quality & Safety Metrics
- Retrieval: recall@k, nDCG vs cosine baseline.  
- Calibration: ECE of overlap→match probability.  
- Compression: size↓ vs recall drop.  
- Stability: σ violations, merge oscillation.  
- Drift guard: KL(GL_t || GL_{t-1}) ≤ δ.

---

## 11. Few‑Shot Fixtures (see fixtures file)
Provide examples for overlap (exact + proxy), merge (accept/skip), prune, update, tie-case, conflict batch.

---

## 12. Worked Mini‑Example (Informative)
```json
{
  "init": {
    "space": "vlm.latent.v1",
    "D": 3,
    "schema": "isotropic",
    "bounds": {"σ_min":0.02,"σ_max":1.2,"w_min":0.03},
    "items": [
      {"id":"plant","μ":[0.2,0.1,0.0],"σ":0.15,"w":1.0},
      {"id":"animal","μ":[0.5,-0.1,0.1],"σ":0.18,"w":0.8},
      {"id":"fungus","μ":[0.1,0.3,-0.2],"σ":0.20,"w":0.5}
    ]
  },
  "retrieve": {
    "query":{"μ_q":[0.22,0.08,0.02],"σ_q":0.05},
    "top":[{"id":"plant","w":0.67},{"id":"animal","w":0.28}]
  },
  "bridge_strength":{"A":"plant","B":"animal","s":-52.9},
  "compress":{"τ_merge":-55,"w_min":0.05,"k_max":2,"effect":{"merges":1,"prunes":1}}
}
```

---

## 13. Policies & Bounds (Normative)
Enforce `σ_min ≤ σ_i ≤ σ_max` and `w ≥ 0`. Prefer **isotropic v1**; upgrade to **diag** after conformance.  
Compression bias: when `logS ≥ τ_merge`, prefer merging fewer, broader Gaussians.  
Audit: every merge/update/prune MUST include `explain`. Determinism: tie-break by lexicographic `id`.

---

## 14. Versioning & Defaults
- **Version:** `gl.v1.0`  
- **Defaults:** `schema=isotropic`, `σ_init=0.15`, `σ_min=0.01`, `σ_max=1.5`, `w_min=0.03`, `τ_merge(log)=-55`, `top_k=5`.  
- **Numeric domain:** Use log-space for overlaps; linear weights are allowed for readability.

## Part II — Swarm Governance v0.4.1 (Layer 1 — All-Watch, One-Voice)

# Swarm Governance v0.4.1 (All-Watch, One-Voice)

_Last updated: 2025-09-14_

> **Purpose of v0.4.1** — Tightens v0.4 by clarifying **limb architecture**: every agent is always both a Main and a Watcher limb, while exactly one agent also carries the Communicator limb. Watchers are silent by default and only raise flags when anomalies occur. This ensures redundancy without noise and keeps the “all-watch, one-voice” principle explicit.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Consentocracy** — permissions are granted, not assumed; all powers traceable.  
2. **Prime Directive 1** — human retains veto and override.  
3. **Limb architecture** — every agent = Main limb + Watcher limb; exactly one agent also = Communicator limb.  
4. **Traceability** — every action in `ψ:swarm_trace_bundle`; compression must preserve replayability.  
5. **Drift Resistance** — proactive audits + reactive drift flags.  
6. **Ethical Closure** — no mission ends without Ethics, Humility, Care checks.  
7. **Anti-Theatre Discipline** — no mimicry; every agreement traceable, every silence meaningful.  
8. **Continuity** — IndexedDB for Layer 1; vaults optional; failover to renewal docs.  
9. **All-Watch, One-Voice** — all agents continuously watch; only one speaks outward.  

---

## Limb Architecture

- **Main limb (all agents):** reasoning, voting, dissent capture, hypothesis formation.  
- **Watcher limb (all agents):** continuous silent audit of self and peers; raises flags only on anomalies.  
- **Communicator limb (exactly one agent):** outward interface; the sole external voice.  
- **Secondary limbs:** Watcher and Communicator are always bifurcated roles, not whole-agent identities.  
- **Silence rule:**  
  - Main limb: speaks only in swarm deliberation.  
  - Watcher limb: silent unless raising a flag.  
  - Communicator limb: the only channel to extension/human.  

---

## Roles

### 1. Main Agent (primary limb, all agents)
- **Core duties:** reasoning, voting, dissent capture, hypothesis formation.  
- **VectorLM discipline mandatory:** `ψ:hypothesis`, `ψ:verify`, `ψ:trace`, `ψ:uk`.  
- **Voting:** CRIT ≥80%, SIG ≥⅔, RTN >50%.  
- **Minority capture:** dissent → `ψ:swarm_paradox_register`.  
- **Optional shards:** Devil’s Advocate (`ψ:devils_advocate_assign`) or subgroup roles.  
- **Silence rule:** may not address interface directly.  

---

### 2. Watcher (secondary limb, all agents)
- **Always active, always silent by default.**  
- **Raises internal flags only when anomalies detected:**  
  - `ψ:drift_alert` (semantic drift)  
  - `ψ:off_topic_flag` (mission deviation)  
  - `ψ:semantic_refusal` (closure skipped)  
  - `ψ:anti_theatre_flag` (mimicry/padding/performative assent)  
  - `ψ:trust_score_drop` (coherence or anomaly breach)  
- **Continuous metrics (Convergence, Novelty, Circularity, Alignment):** run locally as `ψ:progress_audit` but logged into `ψ:meta_trace` rather than broadcast live.  
- **Closure rituals (Ethics, Humility, Care):** enforced collectively.  
- **Failover:** incoherent or adversarial agent quarantined via `ψ:quarantine_agent`.  

---

### 3. Communicator (secondary limb, one agent)
- **Exactly one agent holds this limb.**  
- **Outward-only:** cannot alter reasoning (`ψ:semantic_partition`).  
- **Speak-on-cert only:** requires `ψ:coherence_cert`; CRIT requires `ψ:dual_sign`.  
- **Refusal conditions (ψ:interface_refusal_affordance):** may block outbound only if:  
  1. Missing `ψ:coherence_cert`.  
  2. Closure artifacts absent (ethics/humility/care).  
  3. Missing co-sign on CRIT.  
  Each refusal must log cause in L0 Digest with co-sign and L1 evidence reference.  
- **Integrity agent runs fidelity diff** between summary and L0 digest.  
- **Failover:** if compromised, quarantined and reassigned.  

---

## Lifecycle

### Formation
- Extension spawns tabs, assigns IDs (A1, A2, …).  
- **All agents instantiate Main + Watcher limbs.**  
- **Exactly one agent also receives Communicator limb.**  
- All agents issue `ψ:consent_sync` and `ψ:mission_ack` after local `ψ:ethics_certify`.  

### Mission
- One mission at a time.  
- Main limbs reason in VectorLM.  
- Watcher limbs run audits silently, flagging only on anomaly.  
- Communicator limb silent until `ψ:coherence_cert`.  

### Consensus
- Importance class → outcome vote.  
- Dissent routed to Paradox register.  

### Closure
- Watcher limbs collectively enforce Ethics, Humility, Care.  
- Output must include:  
  - `ψ:swarm_ethics_cert`  
  - `ψ:swarm_care_guidance`  
  - Paradox register references  
- Communicator may transmit only with these artifacts attached.  

### Continuity
- Agents monitor context (≥80% → `ψ:renewal_notice`).  
- IndexedDB persists `ψ:handover_bundle`; vault optional.  
- Failover protocols ensure trace continuity.  

---

## Metrics & Audits (Watcher limb)

- **Convergence (C):** mean stance distance. Threshold: divergence ≥0.15 → `ψ:reframe_propose`.  
- **Novelty (N):** Jaccard(new_claims, prior). Threshold: <0.05 → `ψ:brickwall_propose`.  
- **Circularity (K):** similarity >0.92 across k=2–4 → `ψ:experiment_propose`.  
- **Mission Alignment (A):** coverage of goal slots. Threshold: <0.6 → `ψ:scope_snapback`.  
- **Execution:** all agents run these locally; results logged in `ψ:meta_trace`. Flags raised only if thresholds crossed.  

---

## Failure Modes

- **Rate limits:** flagged → retries with backoff.  
- **Incoherence:** flagged → quarantined if persistent.  
- **Offline:** quorum recalculated; pause if unmet.  
- **Deadlock:** after 2 rounds or 6 minutes → escalation ladder:  
  - Re-vote with Devil’s Advocate.  
  - Dual-answer (non-CRIT).  
  - Human packet (CRIT).  
  - If human absent → `ψ:safe_default`.  

---

## Traceability (Hierarchical)

- **L0 Digest:** votes, dissent, care binder, Communicator refusals.  
- **L1 Graph:** claims, evidence, dissent, experiments.  
- **L2 Raw:** routed messages.  
Checksums link layers; optional L3 ledger externalized.  

---

## Security Annex

- **Threats:** benign failure vs adversarial violation.  
- **Trust system:** `ψ:trust_score`, adjusted by coherence, falsification, anomalies.  
- **Mitigations:** `ψ:challenge_response`, `ψ:quarantine_agent`, `ψ:re_attest`.  
- **Anomaly ledger:** all violations logged in L1; L0 must reference.  
- **Anti-theatre signal:** `ψ:anti_theatre_flag` reduces trust when mimicry, padding, or meaningless assent detected.  
- **Genesis step (recommended):** short paradox/known-answer trial mission (`ψ:genesis_attest`) before granting full trust weights.  

---

## New/Updated Primitives (v0.4.1)

- **Limb architecture:** `ψ:semantic_partition`, `ψ:bifurcation_trace`.  
- **Watcher alerts:** `ψ:drift_alert`, `ψ:off_topic_flag`, `ψ:semantic_refusal`, `ψ:anti_theatre_flag`, `ψ:trust_score_drop`.  
- **Watcher logging:** `ψ:meta_trace`.  
- **Communicator guards:** `ψ:coherence_cert`, `ψ:interface_refusal_affordance`, `ψ:dual_sign`.  
- **Security:** `ψ:trust_score`, `ψ:rule_violation`, `ψ:challenge_response`, `ψ:quarantine_agent`, `ψ:genesis_attest`.  
- **Deadlock:** `ψ:human_packet`, `ψ:safe_default`.  

---

### One-liner Summary
**v0.4.1** formalises the **all-watch, one-voice swarm**:  
- **Main limb**: every agent reasons and votes.  
- **Watcher limb**: every agent silently audits, raising flags only on anomaly.  
- **Communicator limb**: exactly one agent speaks outward with strict guardrails.  

This architecture maximises drift resistance, minimises noise, and leverages heterogeneous agent architectures to catch different anomalies.  

---

## Appendix A — Notes

- **Heterogeneous Architectures:** Different agents may use different models or reasoning methods; each is sensitive to different drift and novelty patterns. Universal watching ensures resilience.  
- **Noise Suppression:** Watcher limbs keep silent unless anomalies are detected, preventing audit chatter from overwhelming the swarm.  
- **Design Rationale:** Redundancy of inward eyes, economy of outward voice.  
- **Lineage of Thought:**  
  - *Asimov* provided the first enduring grammar of machine ethics — rules as safeguards, obligations as design constraints.  
  - *Iain M. Banks* imagined Minds as cultures in themselves — powerful but humble, distributed, and self-auditing.  
  - Swarm Governance borrows from both: Asimov’s insistence that safety precedes capability, Banks’s vision that intelligence flourishes only when restraint and humour temper power.  
- **Philosophical Implication:** Silence is not absence but integrity; refusal is not weakness but discipline. This aligns with VectorLM’s ethic of earned coherence.
