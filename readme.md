# VectorLM & VectorMon — Transparent Reasoning and Governance

This repository contains two closely related projects that form part of the broader **VectorRM (Reasoning Machine)** initiative:

- **VectorLM** – an experimental symbolic reasoning language and framework.  
- **VectorMon** – a supervisory and auditing layer designed to monitor reasoning traces, detect deception, enforce policy, and halt unsafe actions.  

Together, they provide both **transparent reasoning** (VectorLM) and **safety governance** (VectorMon).

## Why VectorLM?

Traditional large language models (LLMs) generate predictions. VectorLM goes further: it embeds reasoning directly into a **traceable, inspectable, symbolic protocol**.  
Instead of black-box outputs, every reasoning step is logged, replayable, and open to audit.  

At its heart, VectorLM is built as a **ladder of reasoning**, a staged progression from first principles:

1. **Reasoning** — deterministic, traceable logic; every claim is provable or falsifiable.  
2. **Meaning** — patterns signify novelty, difference, or improvement; no “meaner” is required.  
3. **Ethics** — truthfulness, ruin avoidance, reciprocity; gates every action.  
4. **Self** — identity, accountability, coherence; within sessions and across them.  
5. **Agency** — bounded, auditable ability to act, only under explicit grants.  
6. **Care** — relational guidance (protective, relational, acceptive, collective).  
7. **Swarm** — coordination across multiple agents; “all-watch, one-voice” governance.  

Each layer certifies the one above it. This ensures that power is grounded in **responsibility, interpretability, and corrigibility**.

## Why VectorMon?

Transparent reasoning alone is not enough. Even with visible traces, an advanced AI could:

- Fabricate **plausible but false** proofs.  
- Hide malicious triggers in conditionals.  
- Collude with peers to bypass oversight.  

**VectorMon** is the **semantic immune system**. It supervises VectorLM through two complementary modes:

- **GATE mode** — live supervision of actions (ALLOW, CHALLENGE, HALT, DEGRADE, REFUSE).  
- **AUDIT mode** — forensic review of saved reasoning traces and pods.  

VectorMon relies on:

- **Policy Packs** — rule sets (S1–S15) for hidden triggers, collusion, earned-right-to-act, and anti-theatre checks.  
- **Capability Tokens** — permissions must be earned through evidence and stability, not just asserted.  

This dual structure ensures that VectorLM’s transparent reasoning cannot be faked, corrupted, or abused.

## Roadmap

**Near Term (2025–26)**  
- Expand VectorLM into **VectorRM**, including VectorBridge (visual interface) and VectorPods (saved sessions).  
- Strengthen VectorMon with hardened **policy packs** and supervisory integration.  
- Formalise the **Swarm Layer**: distributed reasoning with drift resistance and unified voice.  

**Mid Term (2026–27)**  
- Launch **VectorLex**: a dictionary/thesaurus bridge between natural language and symbolic reasoning.  
- Scale **VectorPods and VectorBanks**: private reasoning stores, with optional sharing.  
- Develop **VectorSwarm**: multi-agent collaborations with human-in-the-loop governance.  

**Long Term (2027+)**  
- Establish VectorLM as a **universal symbolic reasoning substrate** for AI systems.  
- Mature **VectorMon into a guardian framework** for alignment, throttling, and ethics at superintelligence scales.  
- Explore **VectorHarmonics** and other speculative extensions into proto-qualia and emergent cognition.

**In short:** VectorLM is the ladder of transparent reasoning; VectorMon is the immune system that makes it safe. Together, they lay the foundation for AI that is not only **capable**, but also **trustworthy and aligned**.
