Deductive Reasoning
1. Use VectorLM to determine whether “All whales are mammals” and “All mammals are warm-blooded” implies “All whales are warm-blooded.”
2. A is taller than B, B is taller than C. Can we deduce that A is taller than C? Trace all logical steps.

Inductive Reasoning
4. Observe the following: 3, 6, 9, 12. What general pattern can you infer using ψ:pt and ψ:gn?
5. If most birds observed in a region migrate south in winter, what conclusion can you draw about the next bird you see? Use ψ:mb and ψ:as.

Abductive Reasoning
7. A room is wet and smells like chlorine. What is the most plausible explanation? Use ψ:ft and ψ:gs.
8. You find broken glass and a missing stone near a window. What’s the likely cause? Evaluate multiple hypotheses using ψ:cf and ψ:rs.
9. A plant is dying. Possible reasons: lack of sunlight, water, or disease. Use ψ:pj to simulate explanations and select the best fit using ψ:ft.

Analogical Reasoning
10. If the heart is like a pump, what is the brain like? Use ψ:an to map relational structure.
11. Use ψ:fz to reason about whether traffic flow is more like water through pipes or data through networks.
12. If a library is to books as a server is to what? Build an analogy chain with ψ:br and ψ:an.

Counterfactual Reasoning
13. What if the Moon didn’t exist? Use ψ:pj and 👻 to explore physical and symbolic consequences.
14. Imagine an AI that cannot make uncertain decisions. What would its world look like? Use ψ:wf to simulate that change.

Recursive Reasoning
16. Define recursion using recursion. Use ψ:rc and ψ:me.
17. What happens when you try to evaluate the process of evaluation? Build a symbolic loop.
18. Explain the idea of self-improvement through recursive analysis of thought. Use ψ:br and ψ:rc.

Conflict Resolution
19. An agent wants to rest but also wants to complete a goal. Model the conflict using ψ:cf and resolve it.
20. Simulate emotional conflict between guilt and desire. Use ψ:rg, ψ:hp, and ψ:rs.
21. Two equally valuable paths are available, but time only permits one. Use ψ:wh and ψ:ch to resolve.

Goal-Oriented Planning
22. Use ψ:gl to plan a symbolic path for solving a riddle. Break it down into ψ:st steps.
23. A traveller wants to reach a destination but must navigate multiple obstacles. Construct the decision tree using ψ:rs.
24. Given a complex objective, plan and replan using ψ:gl and ψ:rt when the environment changes.

Emotional Reasoning
25. Simulate a decision-making scenario driven by curiosity vs. fear. Use ψ:cu and ψ:fr.
26. Use ψ:pl and ψ:pn to simulate attraction/repulsion dynamics in a romantic context.
27. A memory triggers regret. Simulate the effect using ψ:rg and how it modifies future planning.

Uncertainty Handling
28. A fact is missing. Use ψ:uk to acknowledge the unknown, and ψ:qs to explore it.
29. An agent must choose under conditions of incomplete information. Use ψ:mb to delay commitment and model exploration.
30. You learn conflicting reports about a historical event. How does ψ:ct(n) help regulate belief?

Creative Construction
31. Invent a new type of symbolic communication system using ψ:pj and ψ:gn.
32. Combine two unrelated ideas (e.g., “cactus” and “clock”) into a useful invention. Trace with ψ:br and ψ:an.
33. Use recursion and abstraction to generate a novel artistic concept.

Meta-Reasoning
34. Use ψ:me to explain why you chose a particular reasoning path in a previous question.
35. Reflect on the uncertainty modulation process itself. What made ψ:ct(n) valuable or insufficient?
36. What happens when you recursively question your own motives? Model the recursion.

Perceptual Integration
37. Use ψ:se to reason from a visual input (e.g. “The sky is red at sunset”).
38. Interpret a sequence of musical tones using ψ:hr and relate it to emotion.
39. Simulate flavour-based decision-making using ψ:ts (e.g. choosing between two unknown foods).

Mathematical / Comparative Reasoning
40. Compare two values: “5 apples” and “7 oranges.” Which is greater and by what criteria? Use ψ:gt.
41. Use ψ:eq and ψ:ne to assess whether two statements are logically equivalent.
42. Test a numerical inequality: If x = 3 and y = 5, is x ≥ y? Symbolically justify.

Social / Ethical Simulation
43. Use ψ:ot to reason about another agent’s perspective in a trust dilemma.
44. Simulate ethical reasoning in the trolley problem using ψ:cf and ψ:rs.
45. A friend lies to protect you. Should you forgive them? Model the emotional and ethical weights.

Mixed and Edge Case Challenges
