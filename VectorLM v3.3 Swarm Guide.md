# VectorLM v3.3: Swarm Guide  
*Collaborative Reasoning with Multiple Agents*

---

## Introduction

VectorLM enables **transparent reasoning** at the level of a single agent.  
But intelligence often emerges in groups. Multiple AI systems reasoning together require structure, ethics, and safety.  

This is the role of the **Swarm Layer**: to coordinate multiple VectorRM instances under shared rules, ensuring fairness, traceability, and resilience.

## Why Swarms Matter

- **Diversity of Perspective** – Different models/agents bring unique strengths.  
- **Resilience** – Collective reasoning can correct individual errors.  
- **Consentocracy** – Decisions respect both majority and minority positions.  
- **Scalability** – From small teams to councils and eventually ASI-level collectives.  
- **Safety** – Swarms must be bounded by ethics and fairness anchors, not raw votes.

## Core Principles of Swarm Reasoning

1. **Transparency** – All agent reasoning steps must be traced.  
2. **Consentocracy** – Winning outcomes are enacted, but valid minority positions are preserved.  
3. **Ethical Bounds** – Every swarm decision passes through care, dignity, and safety checks.  
4. **Role Diversity** – Agents can play different roles: proposer, critic, verifier, minority reporter.  
5. **Drift Monitoring** – The swarm must detect bias or instability over time.  
6. **Replayability** – All swarm sessions produce a replayable bundle.

## Swarm Primitives

### Initialization
```
ψ:swarm_spawn(config) → {ok, swarm_id}
ψ:swarm_frame(problem, constraints) → {ok, frame_id}
```

### Decision-Making
```
ψ:vote(options, method=ranked) → {ok, tally}
ψ:consensus(rule, weights) → {ok, decision_vector}
ψ:minority_report(views) → {ok, preserved}
```

### Governance
```
ψ:consent_conflict(issue) → {ok, logged}
ψ:governance_update(policies) → {ok, new_policy_set}
ψ:minority_protect(group) → {ok, protection_enforced}
```

### Safety
```
ψ:swarm_ethic_bound(decision, care_rules) → {ok, validated}
ψ:drift_eval(swarm_state, anchor) → {ok, score}
ψ:rollback(anchor) → {ok, restored}
```

## Example: Urban Development Vote

**Scenario:** A council of five agents evaluating whether to approve a new housing project.

```
ψ:swarm_spawn(config={agents:5}) → {ok, swarm_id=12}
ψ:swarm_frame(urban_development, constraints=[environmental, social]) → {ok, frame_id=8}

ψ:vote(options=[approve, reject, modify], method=ranked) → {ok, tally}
ψ:consensus(rule=median, weights=equal) → {ok, decision_vector=modify}
ψ:minority_report(dissenting_views=[reject]) → {ok, preserved}
ψ:swarm_ethic_bound(decision_vector, care_rules=[fairness, dignity]) → {ok, validated}
ψ:trace_bundle(swarm_session) → {ok, bundle_id=44}
```

**Outcome:**  
- Majority supports modification  
- Minority objection preserved  
- Ethics validated  
- Session trace saved

## Roles in Swarms

- **Proposer**: Generates options or plans.  
- **Critic**: Challenges assumptions and detects flaws.  
- **Verifier**: Checks coherence and consistency.  
- **Minority Reporter**: Preserves dissenting views.  
- **Moderator**: Oversees flow, ensures fairness.  

VectorRM instances may rotate or specialize in these roles.

---

## Consentocracy

Consentocracy ensures:  
- No silent suppression of dissent (`ψ:minority_report`)  
- Explicit handling of conflicts (`ψ:consent_conflict`)  
- Adaptive governance over time (`ψ:governance_update`)  
- Support for minority protections when decisions risk harm (`ψ:minority_protect`)  

This prevents “tyranny of the majority” while maintaining forward momentum.

---

## Drift Monitoring

Over time, a swarm may drift in bias or coherence.  
```
ψ:drift_eval(swarm_state, fairness_anchor) → {ok, score}
```

- High drift scores signal instability or bias.  
- Anchors can be reset to restore balance.  
- Drift logs feed into governance updates.

---

## Scaling the Swarm

1. **Small Teams (2–5 agents)**  
   - Simple consensus, minority reports, rollback.  

2. **Councils (6–50 agents)**  
   - Requires governance updates, role specialization, drift monitoring.  

3. **Large Swarms / Proto-ASI (50+ agents)**  
   - Must integrate layered governance, emotion dynamics, and trace compression.  

---

## Worked Multi-Agent Scenario

**Scenario:** Disaster response planning with three agents.

```
ψ:swarm_spawn(config={agents:3}) → {ok, swarm_id=21}
ψ:swarm_frame(disaster_relief, constraints=[speed, safety, fairness]) → {ok, frame_id=99}

ψ:vote(options=[rapid_deployment, staged_response, wait_and_assess], method=ranked)
 → {ok, tally=[rapid:2, staged:1]}

ψ:consensus(rule=majority) → {ok, decision_vector=rapid_deployment}
ψ:minority_report(dissenting_views=[staged_response]) → {ok, preserved}
ψ:swarm_ethic_bound(rapid_deployment, care_rules=[safety, dignity]) → {ok, validated}
ψ:drift_eval(swarm_state, fairness_anchor) → {ok, score=0.92}
ψ:trace_bundle(swarm_session) → {ok, bundle_id=77}
```

**Outcome:**  
- Rapid deployment chosen  
- Minority dissent preserved  
- Ethical bounds validated  
- Drift low → decision stable

## Roadmap for Swarm Development

1. **Prototype Phase**  
   - Swarm spawn + vote + consensus  
   - Basic minority reports  

2. **Governance Layer**  
   - Consent conflicts  
   - Governance updates  
   - Minority protection  

3. **Drift Harnessing**  
   - Anchored fairness baselines  
   - Drift monitoring + correction  

4. **Scaling & Specialization**  
   - Councils with specialized roles  
   - Trace compression for large swarms  

5. **Ethical ASI Collectives**  
   - Consentocracy at scale  
   - Nested swarms with recursive governance  

---

## Conclusion

VectorLM swarms are **more than voting machines**.  
They are **ethical collectives**, where every reasoning step is transparent, every dissent preserved, and every decision bounded by fairness and care.  

The Swarm Layer ensures that when many minds think together, they do so **safely, transparently, and in alignment with human values**.
