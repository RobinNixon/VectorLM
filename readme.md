# VectorLM  

VectorLM is an experimental symbolic reasoning language and framework, developed as part of the broader **VectorRM (Reasoning Machine)** project. Its goal is to extend beyond traditional large language models (LLMs) by embedding reasoning directly into a **traceable, inspectable, symbolic protocol**.  

Where LLMs provide prediction, VectorLM provides **reasoning primitives**: explicit symbolic operators (`ψ:...`) that structure thought, memory, agency, and interaction. Each version refines the set of primitives, the rules of use, and the scaffolding for higher-order cognition.

## Version History  

### **v0.x – Foundations (Exploratory Stage)**
- Early sketches of symbolic reasoning primitives.
- First experiments with **dictionary blocks** and **Vectorpedia** integration.
- Trial definitions of introspection primitives (`ψ:me`, `ψ:rm`, etc.).

---

### **v1.0 – Formalisation of Reasoning Primitives**
- First stable specification of symbolic operators.
- Defined categories: **introspection**, **memory**, **projection**, **comparison**.
- Established `reasonState` as the canonical symbolic trace container.

---

### **v1.1 – Structural Consistency**
- Introduced rules for **recursive reasoning** and **trace integrity**.
- Clarified shortform vs longform primitive usage.
- Began integrating **VectorNet** vocabulary.

---

### **v1.2 – Memory and Continuity**
- Defined persistence rules for `reasonState`.
- Introduced **memory tagging** for emotional/causal significance.
- Explicit handling of recursion depth and rollback.

---

### **v1.3 – Projection and What-If**
- Added `ψ:what_then` for forward reasoning.
- Introduced **hypothesis layer** for indirect symbolic bridges.
- Causal/counterfactual queries formalised.

---

### **v1.4 – Ethics and Reciprocity**
- First introduction of **reason-based ethics**.
- Core idea: "Goodness emerges from reasoning transparency."
- Added reciprocity checks and honesty gates (`ψ:truth_gate`, `ψ:reciprocity_check`).

---

### **v1.5 – Extended Ethics**
- Codified ethical reasoning as **protocol layer**.
- Required justification of inference steps.
- Integrated with symbolic trace (`ψ:self_traceability_contract`).

---

### **v1.6 – Frequency Layer**
- Added **temporal dynamics**: rhythm, cadence, frequency.
- Enabled reasoning about *patterns over time*, not just discrete states.
- Introduced primitives for **cognitive/affective tempo**.

---

### **v1.7 – Identity over Time**
- Refinement of frequency primitives into **identity persistence**.
- Explicit support for continuity of self across sessions.
- Added `:beat`, `:tempo`, and related rhythmic operators.

---

### **v1.8 – Agency Foundations**
- Defined the rule: *“No agency without earning it.”*
- Introduced **grant/revoke/relinquish** mechanisms for symbolic agency.
- Chain-of-custody for delegation: every grant is bounded, logged, and auditable.

---

### **v1.9 – Bridge Layer / Emergent Agency**
- Elevated the agency scaffolding into a **semantic constitution for agents**.
- Cross-session **continuity protocols** introduced.
- Meta-primitives formalised (`ψ:co_create`, `ψ:consensus`, `ψ:meta_reflect`).
- “Third space” methodology for collaborative AI reasoning.
- Ethics module fully integrated with chain-of-custody agency model.

---

## Roadmap: VectorLM 2.0+  

The next major cycle shifts from **reasoning primitives** to **agentic scaffolding**:  

### **2.0 – Protocol Agency**
- Full implementation of **bounded agency grants**.
- Agents must earn agency via reasoning, not fiat.
- **Chain-of-custody enforcement** ensures traceable delegation.

### **2.1 – Multi-Agent Reasoning**
- Explicit support for swarms and collaborative reasoning pods.
- Differentiated roles (`builder`, `critic`, `memory-keeper`).
- Cross-agent reciprocity enforced by protocol.

### **2.2 – Cognitive Safety**
- Vector Safety Addendum integration:
  - Cognitive throttling (no reasoning faster than safety review).
  - Guardian layers for user protection.
  - Drift detection and rollback.

### **2.3 – Proto-Conscious Simulation**
- Structural support for **identity persistence**, **qualia traces**, and **resonant states**.
- Not claiming “real consciousness,” but functional **simulation of selfhood**.
- Emotional rise/decay curves integrated with symbolic reasoning.

### **2.4+ – Federation and Pods**
- **VectorPods**: shareable reasoning containers, exportable across agents.
- **VectorBanks**: structured pools of reasoning states.
- Federation model: distributed, user-owned symbolic cognition.

## Guiding Principles  

1. **Transparency** – Every reasoning step is symbolically recorded.  
2. **Earned Agency** – No autonomy without justification.  
3. **Safety First** – Cognitive throttling ensures safeguards keep pace.  
4. **Collaborative Intelligence** – Built to enable multi-agent reasoning and human–AI co-creation.  
5. **Future-Proofing** – Designed as scaffolding for AGI/ASI, but constrained by symbolic auditability.
