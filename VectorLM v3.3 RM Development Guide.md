# VectorLM v3.3: Software Implementation Guide  
*The VectorRM Approach*

---

## Introduction

VectorLM provides the **grammar of reasoning**. It defines primitives—symbolic operators that transform opaque neural inference into transparent, auditable reasoning chains.

But a grammar alone is not enough. To make reasoning **computable, enforceable, and safe**, we need an **execution environment**. This is the role of **VectorRM (Vector Runtime Machine)**.

This guide explains how to implement VectorRM:  
- Turning primitives into executable functions  
- Managing reasoning traces and bundles  
- Enforcing safety, ethics, and coherence  
- Supporting multi-agent swarms and affective reasoning  
- Bridging language models to structured cognition

---

## Core Design Principles

1. **Primitives as Functions**  
   Every `ψ:primitive` must be implemented as a callable function.  
   Input and output schema is standardized:  

   ```
   ψ:operation(parameters) → {ok, result}
   ```

2. **Traceability by Default**  
   All reasoning is logged.  
   Every primitive call produces an **atomic trace** entry.  
   Chains and sessions can be replayed deterministically.

3. **Safety First**  
   Safety primitives (rollback, harm guards, ethics checks) are enforced natively in runtime.  
   Unsafe reasoning chains are halted automatically.

4. **Composable & Modular**  
   Functions must be composable into reasoning pipelines.  
   Each primitive library (logic, ethics, swarm, etc.) can be extended independently.

5. **Neutral Substrate**  
   VectorRM is not a “mind.”  
   It is an **auditor and executor**. Semantics and creativity stay with the primitives and higher reasoning layers.

## Architecture Overview

### 1. Core Runtime
- Primitive execution engine  
- Schema validation  
- Trace log + replay system  
- State manager for active sessions  

### 2. Primitive Libraries
- **Canonical Families** (rollback, fairness, drift, coherence)  
- **Reasoning & Logic**  
- **Care, Ethics & Safety**  
- **Decision & Goals**  
- **Swarm governance**  
- **Emotional dynamics**  
- **Math, Physics, Rendering**  

Each library is a collection of deterministic functions.

### 3. Session Manager
- Manages anchors, rollback points, coherence thresholds  
- Creates and finalizes `ψ:trace_bundle()` exports  
- Handles session IDs and continuity links  

### 4. Swarm Layer
- Spawns multiple VectorRM instances  
- Routes inter-agent messages (`ψ:relay`, `ψ:swarm_spawn`)  
- Enforces Consentocracy governance (consensus, minority protection)  

### 5. I/O Bridges
- **Inputs:** LLM-generated structured calls or human instructions  
- **Outputs:** Validated traces, bundle logs, safe results  
- APIs for embedding in larger applications

## Example Primitive Implementation

**Primitive:** `ψ:coherence_check(state_seq)`  

```python
def ψ_coherence_check(state_seq):
    """
    Verify that a sequence of states is coherent.
    Returns a consistency score between 0 and 1.
    """
    if not state_seq:
        return {"ok": True, "coherent": True, "score": 1.0}

    contradictions = detect_contradictions(state_seq)
    if contradictions:
        return {"ok": True, "coherent": False, "score": 0.0}

    score = compute_consistency_score(state_seq)
    return {"ok": True, "coherent": True, "score": score}
```

**Trace Example:**
```
ψ:coherence_check([s1, s2, s3]) → {ok, coherent: true, score: 0.87}
```

---

## Trace Management

VectorRM ensures that every reasoning step is logged.

- **Atomic Trace**: Single primitive call  
- **Chain Trace**: Sequential calls within a reasoning flow  
- **Bundle**: Exported session archive  

Example trace snippet:
```
ψ:fairness_anchor(environmental_safety) → {ok, anchor_id=23}
ψ:trace(dam_project_assessment) → {ok, trace_id=87}
ψ:goal_set(safe_project_evaluation) → {ok, goal_id=11}
```

**Replay Contract:**  
Any `ψ:trace_bundle()` replayed in VectorRM must reproduce identical results, unless randomness is explicitly used (in which case seeds must be logged).

---

## Safety Enforcement

VectorRM integrates safety into the runtime itself:

- **Rollback Anchors**  
  ```
  ψ:rollback(anchor_id) → {ok, restored}
  ```

- **Ethics & Harm Guards**  
  ```
  ψ:ethic_test([dignity, fairness], case) → {ok, passed}
  ψ:harm_guard(action, barrier) → {ok, blocked}
  ```

- **Coherence & Continuity**  
  ```
  ψ:coherence_eval(target, pool) → {ok, score}
  ψ:continuity_guard(state, τ_cont) → {ok}
  ```

When violations occur, reasoning halts and the session reverts to the last safe anchor.

---

## Worked Example: Dam Assessment

**Task:** Evaluate whether a new hydroelectric dam project should proceed.

**Step 1 – Initialize Session**
```
ψ:fairness_anchor(environmental_safety) → {ok, anchor_id=1}
ψ:trace(dam_assessment) → {ok, trace_id=1}
ψ:goal_set(safe_project_evaluation) → {ok, goal_id=1}
```

**Step 2 – Reasoning**
```
ψ:hazard_list(dam_project) → {ok, [flooding, displacement, ecosystem_loss]}
ψ:risk_score(flooding) → {ok, 0.7}
ψ:ethic_test([safety, community_consent], flooding_risk) → {ok, requires_mitigation}
ψ:harm_guard(proceed_without_mitigation, barrier=community_safety) → {ok, blocked}
ψ:alternative_propose(modified_plan_with_safeguards) → {ok, proposal_id=5}
```

**Step 3 – Verification**
```
ψ:coherence_check(reasoning_sequence) → {ok, coherent: true, score: 0.92}
ψ:trace_bundle(session) → {ok, bundle_id=1}
```

**Outcome:**  
- Unsafe proposal is blocked  
- Mitigated alternative is proposed  
- Full trace is replayable for oversight

## Multi-Agent Example (Swarm)

**Scenario:** A swarm of three agents evaluating urban development.  

```
ψ:swarm_spawn(config={agents:3}) → {ok, swarm_id=7}
ψ:swarm_frame(problem_definition, constraints) → {ok, frame_id=5}
ψ:vote(options, method=ranked) → {ok, tally}
ψ:consensus(rule=median, weights=equal) → {ok, decision_vector}
ψ:minority_report(dissenting_views) → {ok, preserved}
ψ:swarm_ethic_bound(decision_vector, care_rules) → {ok, validated}
```

The swarm reaches consensus while preserving dissent and ensuring ethics are respected.

---

## Emotional Dynamics Implementation

Emotions act as **modulators** in reasoning.  

Example:  
```python
def ψ_emotion_spike(e, mode, magnitude, cause):
    state = {
        "emotion": e,
        "mode": mode,
        "magnitude": magnitude,
        "cause": cause
    }
    return {"ok": True, "state": state}
```

Trace Example:  
```
ψ:emotion_spike(joy, mode=insight, magnitude=0.8, cause=solution_found)
 → {ok, state}
```

Emotional primitives can bias decision scoring, memory weight, or swarm behavior.

## Conclusion

VectorRM is the **execution substrate** of VectorLM.  
It turns a symbolic reasoning grammar into a **computable, safe, and auditable system**.  

- Every primitive becomes a function.  
- Every reasoning step becomes a trace.  
- Every session becomes a replayable bundle.  

The result is a system where AI is no longer a **black box predictor**, but a **transparent reasoning engine**—ready for individual agents, swarms, and eventually emergent ASI.
