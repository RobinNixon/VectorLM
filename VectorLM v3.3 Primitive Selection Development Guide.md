# VectorLM v3.3: Primitive Selection & Workflow Optimization Guide  
*Systematic Approaches to Primitive Prioritization and Enforcement*

---

## Problem Statement

VectorLM provides 600+ primitives across 40+ categories, but currently leaves primitive selection entirely to LLM discretion. This creates critical vulnerabilities:

### Selection Inconsistency
Different LLMs choose different primitives for identical scenarios, undermining standardization and reproducibility.

### Safety Gaps
LLMs may skip essential safety checks (`ψ:harm_guard`, `ψ:ethic_test`) when prioritizing efficiency or under time pressure.

### Complexity Overload
Without guidance, LLMs may either:
- Choose overly complex primitive chains that obscure reasoning
- Use insufficient primitives that miss critical analysis steps

### Gradual Drift
Absence of mandatory primitive sequences allows reasoning to gradually drift away from VectorLM principles while maintaining syntactic compliance.

### Context Blindness
LLMs lack systematic approaches for adapting primitive selection to different risk levels, domains, or urgency contexts.

## Why Structured Primitive Selection Matters

### Reliability
Consistent primitive application across different AI systems and contexts ensures predictable reasoning quality.

### Safety Assurance
Mandatory safety primitive sequences prevent accidental omission of critical checks in high-stakes decisions.

### Efficiency Optimization
Clear primitive prioritization rules prevent both under-analysis and over-complexity.

### Drift Prevention
Structured workflows with required checkpoints maintain alignment with VectorLM principles over time.

### Domain Adaptation
Context-specific primitive protocols enable appropriate reasoning depth for different scenarios.

## Proposed Solution Framework

### 1. Mandatory Primitive Sequences (MPS)

Define required primitive chains for critical reasoning categories:

#### Safety-Critical Decisions
```
REQUIRED: ψ:fairness_anchor() → ψ:hazard_list() → ψ:risk_score() → ψ:ethic_test() → ψ:harm_guard()
```

#### Coding Tasks
```
REQUIRED: ψ:code_intent() → ψ:vibe_expand() → ψ:goal_set() → implementation → ψ:code_run() → ψ:code_debug()
```

#### Multi-Agent Decisions
```
REQUIRED: ψ:swarm_frame() → reasoning → ψ:consensus() → ψ:minority_report() → ψ:swarm_ethic_bound()
```

### 2. Context-Adaptive Protocols (CAP)

#### Emergency/Time-Critical Context
- **Streamlined safety essentials only**
- Skip comprehensive analysis primitives
- Mandatory: `ψ:hazard_list`, `ψ:harm_guard`, `ψ:rollback` capability

#### Research/Analysis Context
- **Comprehensive primitive usage**
- Mandatory uncertainty handling: `ψ:uncertainty`, `ψ:hypothesis_bridge`
- Required evidence evaluation: `ψ:truth_gate`, `ψ:plausibility`

#### Creative/Innovation Context
- **Balanced creativity and safety**
- Mandatory: `ψ:creativity_guard`, `ψ:dignity_preserve`
- Optional: Extended novelty and aesthetic primitives

#### High-Stakes/Irreversible Context
- **Maximum safety and verification**
- Mandatory: Full safety sequence + `ψ:counterfactual` + `ψ:what_then`
- Required: Multi-agent validation when possible

### 3. Efficiency Optimization Rules (EOR)

#### Primitive Redundancy Prevention
- Detect overlapping primitive functions
- Consolidate similar operations into single calls
- Maintain audit trail while reducing verbosity

#### Computational Cost Awareness
- Rank primitives by computational complexity
- Provide lightweight alternatives for resource-constrained contexts
- Enable graceful degradation under load

#### Depth vs. Breadth Trade-offs
- Define maximum reasoning chain length by context
- Specify when to use comprehensive vs. focused analysis
- Balance thoroughness with practical constraints

### 4. Anti-Drift Enforcement (ADE)

#### Mandatory Drift Monitoring
```
REQUIRED every N reasoning steps: ψ:drift_eval(current_state, anchor)
```

#### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- Drift score exceeding defined thresholds
- Missing mandatory safety primitives
- Logical inconsistency detection

#### Anchor Reinforcement
- Periodic `ψ:fairness_anchor` reaffirmation
- Explicit ethical principle restatement
- Trace coherence verification

## Implementation Approaches

### Approach 1: Prompt-Level Enforcement

**Mechanism:** Enhanced prompt templates with mandatory primitive specifications

**Advantages:**
- Works with existing LLM systems
- No infrastructure changes required
- Immediate implementation possible

**Limitations:**
- Relies on LLM compliance
- Difficult to enforce systematically
- May increase prompt complexity

**Example Implementation:**
```
"MANDATORY: Begin with ψ:fairness_anchor() and ψ:trace(). 
For safety decisions, you MUST use this sequence: 
ψ:hazard_list() → ψ:risk_score() → ψ:ethic_test() → ψ:harm_guard()
Failure to follow this sequence invalidates the reasoning trace."
```

### Approach 2: VectorRM Runtime Enforcement

**Mechanism:** Built-in primitive selection logic in VectorRM execution environment

**Advantages:**
- Guaranteed compliance
- Systematic enforcement across all contexts
- Can adapt to runtime conditions

**Limitations:**
- Requires VectorRM implementation
- May reduce LLM reasoning flexibility
- Complex rule engine needed

**Example Implementation:**
```python
def enforce_safety_sequence(context, risk_level):
    if risk_level >= HIGH_RISK:
        mandatory_primitives = [
            "fairness_anchor", "hazard_list", 
            "risk_score", "ethic_test", "harm_guard"
        ]
        return validate_primitive_sequence(context, mandatory_primitives)
```

### Approach 3: Hybrid Guidance System

**Mechanism:** Combine prompt guidance with runtime validation

**Advantages:**
- Balances flexibility with enforcement
- Provides learning opportunities
- Enables gradual adoption

**Limitations:**
- More complex to implement
- Requires coordination between components
- May create inconsistent behavior

**Example Implementation:**
- Prompt templates suggest primitive sequences
- VectorRM validates compliance and flags violations
- System learns from successful patterns over time

### Approach 4: Adaptive Primitive Selection AI

**Mechanism:** Dedicated AI system for optimal primitive selection

**Advantages:**
- Context-aware optimization
- Learns from success/failure patterns
- Can balance multiple constraints

**Limitations:**
- Adds system complexity
- Requires training data
- May introduce new failure modes

**Example Implementation:**
```
ψ:primitive_select(context, constraints, history) → {ok, recommended_sequence[]}
ψ:primitive_validate(proposed_sequence, context) → {ok, compliant?, suggestions[]}
```

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Over-Prescription Risk
**Problem:** Rigid primitive requirements may stifle valid reasoning approaches
**Mitigation:** 
- Provide escape hatches for exceptional cases
- Regular review and updating of mandatory sequences
- Community feedback on primitive requirements

### Compliance Theater Risk
**Problem:** LLMs may follow primitive syntax without genuine reasoning
**Mitigation:**
- Validate reasoning quality, not just primitive usage
- Include coherence and effectiveness metrics
- Use VCF to capture pseudo-compliance failures

### Complexity Explosion Risk
**Problem:** Too many rules may make VectorLM unusable
**Mitigation:**
- Start with minimal mandatory sequences
- Expand gradually based on evidence
- Maintain clear documentation and training

### Context Misjudgment Risk
**Problem:** Inappropriate primitive selection for actual context
**Mitigation:**
- Provide clear context classification guidelines
- Enable context override mechanisms
- Include context validation in reasoning traces

## Conclusion

Structured primitive selection transforms VectorLM from a flexible toolkit into a disciplined methodology. While this reduces some LLM autonomy, it provides essential guardrails for reliability, safety, and efficiency.

The proposed framework balances enforcement with adaptability, ensuring that primitive selection serves the goals of transparent, ethical, and effective reasoning. Success requires careful implementation, ongoing evaluation, and community engagement to refine protocols based on real-world evidence.

Without systematic primitive selection guidance, VectorLM risks becoming compliance theater. With it, VectorLM becomes a robust foundation for trustworthy AI reasoning across all domains.
