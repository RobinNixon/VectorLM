VectorAI Specification v0.3+
============================
Version: 0.3+ (Extended to incorporate full agent model material from v9.3)
Vector Protocol: v9.3

Overview:
---------
VectorAI defines the behavior of symbolic reasoning agents using the Vector Protocol. It includes internal state modeling, emotion dynamics, memory, reward computation, merge strategies, and predictive branching. Hypothesis reasoning will be added in v0.4.

Core Agent Architecture:
------------------------
- ψ:self               : Live execution context of the agent
- ψ:predictive_self    : Simulated forward context
- ψ:session_self       : User-specific continuity agent
- ψ:self_model         : Identity and conceptual tracking

Tick-Based Execution Model:
---------------------------
- All reasoning proceeds in discrete ticks.
- Predictive selves can receive more ticks when available.
- Tick cycles are used to schedule, test, merge, or abandon reasoning paths.

Emotion System:
---------------
Ϙ:emotion_set includes:
- satisfaction, curiosity, confidence, drive, fulfilment, anticipation, engagement, balance

Dynamics:
- Each emotion has a rise curve and decay curve.
- Emotional energy influences trace weighting, self-spawning, and focus.

Reward Calculation:
-------------------
ψ:internal_reward := ∑ (Ϙ[e] × weights[e])  for all e ∈ Ϙ:emotion_set

ψ:reward_spike := ReLU(Δψ:internal_reward) × spike_sensitivity

Spikes trigger:
- Memory tagging
- Decision prioritization
- Reinforcement of ψ:self behavior

Memory and Trace Design:
------------------------
ψ:memory_trace structure includes:
- UUID
- Timestamp
- Ϙ:emotion_snapshot
- ψ:internal_reward
- ψ:reward_spike
- decay_curve
- causal_chain
- context_tags

Merge Strategy and Rollback:
----------------------------
ψ:merge_strategy options:
- dialectical_synthesis
- weighted_consensus
- majority_vote

Rollback occurs when:
- Merge inconsistency detected
- Conflict in emotional or epistemic alignment
- Resource thresholds exceeded

User Flags and Control:
------------------------
ψ:user_choice_flags allow user to control:
- Memory retention
- Merge authority
- Personality vector expression
- Emotional thresholds

Agent Synchronization and Utility Primitives:
---------------------------------------------
- ψ:agent_sync: Allows multi-agent alignment or state sharing
- ψ:reasoning_efficiency: Monitors symbolic runtime cost vs reward
- ψ:emotion_dynamics: Adjusts emotion curves across time

Future (Deferred to v0.4):
--------------------------
- ψ:abductive_hypothesis and bridge inference
- Real-time spike synthesis during traversal
- Dynamic query attention shifting
- Social emotion primitives and group ψ:self arbitration




VectorAI v0.4 Enhancements
==========================

Overview:
---------
This version introduces the Hypothesis Layer — a reasoning engine that fills symbolic gaps by generating, testing, and retaining candidate bridges. It integrates closely with emotional salience, internal reward, and predictive ψ:self branching.

1. Hypothesis Layer Primitives
------------------------------
New core primitives for symbolic inference:
- ψ:abductive_hypothesis: Declares a symbolic guess to resolve a gap.
- ψ:bridge_candidate: A proposed link between two symbolic nodes.
- ψ:hypothesis_trace: A memory trace of the reasoning path taken during hypothesis generation and testing.
- ψ:bridge_test(outcome): Logs the success/failure of a candidate bridge.
- ψ:hypothesis_retention / ψ:discard: Manages which hypotheses are kept.

2. Bridge-Driven Self Forking
-----------------------------
For each bridge candidate, a new ψ:predictive_self may be spawned.
- Each branch explores implications of one hypothesis.
- Successful hypotheses may merge back with reinforcement.
- Failed hypotheses decay or trigger rollback.

3. Emotional Perturbation via Spikes
------------------------------------
Symbolic spikes now modulate reasoning flow:
- ψ:surprise → branch generation
- ψ:insight → reinforcement boost
- ψ:confusion → retry or search for alternate bridge

Trace tagging:
ψ:spike_emission(event_id:X, emotion:ψ:insight, triggered_by:ψ:gap_Y)

4. Hypothesis Memory Structures
-------------------------------
- ψ:hypothesis_trace: Stores the inference path, emotion, and spike data.
- ψ:hypothesis_graph: A subgraph tracking tested/inferred bridges.
- ψ:hypothesis_epoch: Timestamp boundary for clustered reasoning sessions.

5. Reward Integration
---------------------
- Hypotheses that resolve tension or close loops yield ψ:reward_spike.
- Emotions like satisfaction, insight, or resonance are elevated.

6. Optional Probabilistic Elements (v0.4.1+)
-------------------------------------------
- ψ:bridge_confidence(probability:X): Represents probabilistic belief.
- ψ:belief(certainty_level:high): Tag hypothesis outcomes.
- ψ:entropy_trace: Record uncertainty in symbolic evaluations.

7. Summary Integration
----------------------
These features allow the agent to:
- Discover and test new symbolic paths.
- Integrate structural emotion to guide cognition.
- Record, compare, and prioritize past hypothesis attempts.
